<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/doodad.jpg" width="86" height="12" alt="decoration" />
</div>
<p>The success of “Ten Dollars Enough,” as it appeared
serially in the pages of “Good Housekeeping,” and the
numerous letters received by the editor of that magazine
asking for it in more convenient shape, has led to its
publication in its present form.</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to learn from these same letters
that the writers have tried Molly’s recipes with such
success, there being, I am assured by the same gentleman,
but two exceptions (and one of these candidly says
the fault might be her own) among the large number
who expressed satisfaction.</p>

<p>This testimony is especially gratifying, showing, as it
does, how earnest and faithful my readers have been;
for, although the directions were minutely given and
every effort made to meet difficulties, all <i>my</i> care would
not have sufficed to produce success, had there not been
faithful coöperation on the part of those who followed
them. I take this opportunity to make clear two matters
which, I found early in the course of the story, were
lost sight of by two or three readers, perhaps others.</p>

<p>I allude to the prices of provisions and the amount of
cooking accomplished in a given time.</p>

<p>To those who questioned the cost of articles I would
say: they forgot, reading in <i>December</i>, when they were
doubtless paying higher prices, that the prices quoted
were for <i>September</i>. To another who quotes the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
price <i>she</i> has to pay for certain things, I only say:
Molly was keeping house with some luxury, on the
same amount of table-money as many require to live
very plainly. This could not be done except by buying
everything only in its season; if beyond a certain price,
she waited for it to get lower.</p>

<p>This brings me to what is after all the gist of the
matter. “Ten Dollars Enough” was intended for readers
in widely different parts of the country. It would
have readers where the meat and poultry prices would
seem very high, and the groceries equally low. I therefore
decided to take average New York retail prices
and not to go below them.</p>

<p>There may be cities and suburbs where the prices are
higher than in New York, but in my experience these
are few compared with the many where they are lower.</p>

<p>As to the question of time, Molly is not represented
as an inexperienced young wife, but as a graduate of
cooking-schools, who could herself have joined the
corps of culinary teachers had it been necessary.</p>

<p>Her expertness had not come without many failures,
and the readers of “Ten Dollars Enough” were invited
to profit by the finished result of her failures and
experiments. Because she had often failed before she
succeeded, she was able to avert failure from Marta or
others.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, that Molly knew precisely
what to do and how to do it, it will be readily seen that
her most elaborate dinner was very simple indeed, compared
with the <i>ménu</i> prepared by one lady and her assistant
at any first-rate cooking demonstration, in the
same space of time.</p>

<small>MR. AND MRS. BISHOP TRY THE EXPERIMENT.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Beef</span> steak, cod steak, mutton chop, and hash!”</p>

<p>This bill of fare, glibly rattled off by a neat waitress,
promised a very satisfying breakfast, supplemented as it
was by abundant cream-of-tartar biscuit and potatoes.
Yet Mrs. Bishop thought this morning, as she had done
for three hundred out of the three hundred and sixty-five
mornings she had heard it, she would gladly have
exchanged all for a cup of really fine coffee, a fresh
egg, and some good home-made bread and butter. Needless
to say, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop were boarding, and doing
so at a very good house, for the money they were
able to pay,—$20 per week for the two. Yet to this
couple, reared with luxury and refinement, the very
abundance was nauseating.</p>

<p>“You ate no breakfast again, Puss. What am I to do
with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall do very well. I am sure one has nothing
to complain of, and if Mrs. Jones were to cater to <i>our</i>
tastes she would not satisfy her other boarders.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a coarse substantial abundance about it,
that always strikes me with wonder as to how it is done
for the money”—</p>

<p>“And yet, Harry, wouldn’t you enjoy a nice little
breakfast for our two selves? Oh, if we could only keep
house!”</p>

<p>“My darling, I wish to keep house just as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
you do, but with my income such housekeeping would
be very different from what you think. You would have
to limit the clean table-cloths and napkins, and stint
yourself in everything, to make both ends meet.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could convince you, Harry, that it need
not be so. You don’t know what a good manager I
should be.”</p>

<p>“Dear little woman, I couldn’t have you make a
drudge of yourself, and believe me, you don’t realize the
difference between practice and theory. I know several
men who have good, self-denying wives, and just my income,
but I could not look forward to the narrowness of
such houses as theirs, nor wish to see you in one. While
we are boarding we can’t pretend to have a home; there
is no temptation to ask a friend to a meal, no shame if
one comes and it isn’t good.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop turned a smiling face on her husband.</p>

<p>“That is the secret, Harry. You are afraid of being
ashamed of my housekeeping. Shall I promise you
that you shall never dread to bring a friend home for
fear of a soiled table-cloth, and a too economical dinner?
I assure you I haven’t been to cooking-schools for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“You dear enthusiast! If it were not for your own
sake I’d let you try.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop executed a little dance of joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry, you can’t go back on that, you mustn’t!
Do let us go through this winter in our own house.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop only said, taking out his watch—</p>

<p>“By Jove! I have only time to catch the car. Goodbye,
dear.” Pressing a hearty kiss on her soft cheek,
he rushed down the stairs and out of the house.</p>

<p>There was quite a little romance about this young
couple, which I will relate here, that those who may
follow the young wife’s trials and triumphs may understand
some that she had to fear. Harry Bishop was the
son of a prosperous merchant, who, as is the fashion in
this America of ours, lived almost like a prince on the
profits of his business, but, as his family was large, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his wife ambitious and extravagant, it was not very certain
that he would be able to provide a fortune for each
of his children. For this reason he and Mrs. Bishop
were anxious that those children should marry money.</p>

<p>When Harry declared his intention of marrying, instead
of the rich Miss Vanderpool his mother had looked
out for him, pretty, penniless Molly Marsh, the anger
and disappointment at home had been very great, and although
it is not the fashion in this country to cast off the
sons and daughters who make rash marriages, they did
the next thing to it,—they disapproved so strongly that
Molly rarely visited the grand home Harry had given up
to marry her, and Harry’s father in his anger had said:</p>

<p>“Do you remember, sir, that your paltry salary wouldn’t
pay the rent of a house in a decent location? and
you propose to keep a wife on it! One thing you may
be sure, ‘as you make your bed so you must lie,’ and
when you have a mass of unpaid bills, you mustn’t look
to <i>me</i> to pay ’em.”</p>

<p>“I never will, sir. I am sorry for Molly’s sake you
take it like this, but I hope in time you will see that
I am right to choose happiness instead of riches.”</p>

<p>And then Harry’s mother had pictured the sordid
home kept on $100 a month, and derisively asked if he
supposed he would be happy after the honeymoon was
over, eating common coarse food in a shabby little dining-room.</p>

<p>“The idea of it! You are the last person, Harry, to
content yourself in that way. Why, you criticise even
my cook; how will you do with no cook at all?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t criticise, dear mother, if you did the
cooking.”</p>

<p>They had been married a year now, and Molly and
Harry paid rare visits to his father’s house, and she,
poor young wife, was made to feel how much her husband
had sacrificed for her, and she knew, good as Harry
was, he would be rather exacting in his own home;
that, though for love of her he might not express himself,
small deficiencies would jar on him, and that in beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to keep house she would be undertaking a great
deal.</p>

<p>“But that will be my share. If by devoting time
to my housekeeping, I can make Harry’s money go half
as far again as it would otherwise do, I shall do as much
as if I earned half as much as he.”</p>

<p>And so during that year of boarding and leisure,
Molly had attended cooking-classes, with a married
friend, and had gone home with her and they had practiced
together. She had read, too, everything she could
find about housekeeping, and Harry laughed, sometimes,
till the tears ran down his cheeks at what he called her
“paper housekeeping.”</p>

<p>Yet her pictures of that ideal home they were to
have were very alluring to him too, and this particular
morning, when their boarding-house life had lasted just
one year, her words had taken deeper hold than ever
before. That evening he returned with a very mysterious
look on his face.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Harry?” asked Molly, merrily.
“What plot are you brewing?”</p>

<p>“How would you like to pass a winter in the country?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because we can put your longed-for experiment to
the test. John Winfield is going to take his wife to
Europe on the first of September, and wants to let his
cottage furnished for the bare rent he pays: $20 per
month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry! and we will take it? It is such a cozy
little place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I think we may venture on this experiment.
If it happens that we tire of housekeeping in a
few months, we shall not be burdened with furniture
that we don’t want, and if you are as happy as you think,
we can take a little house and furnish it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop looked the joy she felt, and all that
evening they were discussing plans and prospects.</p>

<p>Many of my readers will wonder, perhaps, why this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
young couple looked upon beginning housekeeping on
Harry’s income as such a tremendous experiment, when
so many live and bring up families on much less. But
there was no disguising the fact that Harry’s bringing-up
in his father’s luxurious house had made him fastidious,
and he shrank from the too frugal table that he associated
with such means, and, even more, the necessity
of foregoing in his own house the refinement he had
been accustomed to. This lack being in the house of
another person irked him less.</p>

<p>Molly’s dread was mixed with a trembling desire to
show her husband what sort of a wife he had married.</p>

<p>“I feel just a doll while boarding, with nothing to
think of but my clothes. You don’t know whether I am
fit to be a helpmeet or not,” she had often said, and he
had replied, “My darling, I take it all on faith; you
are too good for me, even if you could not sew on a button.”</p>

<p>But Molly’s trembling did not come from fear of facing
life in a cottage. She knew herself, but she did
think that Harry might grow to repent the step. She
feared also the criticism of his mother, ever watchful for
a trip on her part.</p>

<p>Ah! what agony it would be to her, if her husband
should ever regret the sacrifice he had made! But from
such thoughts as these, that kept her awake far into the
night while Harry slept soundly at her side, she would
turn to a vision of herself as a triumphant little matron.</p>

<p>“I cannot fail! My time and ingenuity will certainly
supply the deficiency of money.”</p>

<p>Molly had kept house for an invalid mother, who, for
economy’s sake, had lived in a small French town, and
after her mother’s death she had found herself forced to
earn her living as governess, for her mother’s income
died with her.</p>

<p>Thus, although she had often told Harry she could
keep house, he had smiled, pinched her cheek, and told
her she did not realize the difference between keeping
house in France and doing so in America, with a newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
imported Bridget for <i>aide de cuisine</i>, and as Molly
did not like to boast, she had to let him keep his own
opinion. But oh, how she longed to show him what unknown
resources lay within her! And now the chance
was hers.</p>

<p>After the first joyful hour, she behaved very soberly.
She would take as a matter of course all Harry’s misgivings
as to the commissariat department, for I am
sorry to say Harry Bishop, although a Harvard graduate,
and a fairly intellectual young man, did think a
great deal of the enjoyment of life consisted in a good
table, by which he meant not good food only, but good
cooking and dainty service, and how they were to have
this on $100 per month he could not see, unless his income
were all spent for servants and food. When he
told this to Molly she said:</p>

<p>“No, I propose that we keep house, and spend exactly
what we do for this one room and our board; that
is, $80 per month. It must be divided in this way: $20
for rent (we must never go beyond that), $12 for servant,
and $10 a week for housekeeping; that is, $77 a
month. The three remaining dollars, with the four or
five we now spend for car fare, will buy your commutation
ticket.”</p>

<p>“$10 a week for housekeeping! I am afraid you’ll
find that will make a poor show, little wife,” he said
caressingly. “I shall think we are happy and fortunate,
if the $20 we now allow for our clothes and outside
expenses will cover the deficit at the end of the
month.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see $10 is enough.”</p>

<p>He laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“I guess, Pussy, we shall both see things grow ‘small
by degrees and beautifully less,’ toward the end of each
month.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hope not,” said Molly meekly, for now that
she hoped her hour of trial and triumph was coming,
she could afford to let him anticipate evil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>AT HOME.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 1st of September our young couple took possession
of their new house.</p>

<p>It was a small house, or rather cottage, in the fashionable
New Jersey town of Greenfield, and contained
a dining-room, sitting-room and kitchen on the first
floor, and four rooms above arranged as bed-room,
guest-room, servants’ room and sewing-room. It was as
slightly built as a house could be, probably, yet in better
taste than most houses of its class, and Mrs. Winfield’s
taste in furnishing was excellent, so that even Harry’s
fastidious eye was satisfied.</p>

<p>As for Molly, she spent her first hour in the house
promenading from room to room, such a luxurious idea
of freedom and space did that small house give her.</p>

<p>“Think, Harry! We can actually change rooms
when we like.”</p>

<p>“Poor little Molly, I did not know that you had hated
boarding so, or I should not have refused to try this experiment
long ago. I did it for your sake.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll have such a good time now, that
we won’t think of anything else.”</p>

<p>“What time is your Gretchen to arrive?”</p>

<p>“Not Gretchen, but Marta. She came an hour ago,
while you were seeing to the baggage, and is busy down
stairs, where I must go to her if we are to have any
lunch, while you put your books in order.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lunch! Never mind lunch to-day, bread and
cheese will do”—</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Molly, shaking her head and laughing,
“I’ve brought you from the land of abundance; I
must take care that you are not made to suffer the first
day.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta, Molly’s servant, was a newly arrived German
girl whom she had had the courage to take from Castle
Garden.</p>

<p>“She will be as green as grass, Molly,” Harry had
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but at least it is better she should
know nothing than know how to do things badly; it is
easier to teach than to unteach.”</p>

<p>“All right, my dear, we will go to Castle Garden,
then, and interview a new arrival from Germany.”</p>

<p>They did so, and found a thick, short, strong, but stupid-looking
girl was the only one whom it seemed possible
to take into the house. Molly was a little crestfallen,
so far did Marta seem from what she had hoped
to meet with. Yet she asked only $10 per month.</p>

<p>“That is $2.00 to the good,” thought Molly, “and by
promising her $12 when she can do my work as I wish,
she will have something to work for. I believe that is
where people make a mistake in our country. The incompetent
girls, if they have only impudence enough to
ask it, get as good wages as the competent.”</p>

<p>Marta had arrived with two very large trunks, each
of them no doubt the Thuringian equivalent for a Saratoga,
at which excess of baggage Molly had marveled.
Molly had taken her to her room, and told her to go
down when ready and begin taking things out of the
kitchen closets. This she had heard her doing when
Harry had asked when she was to arrive.</p>

<p>Molly found Marta attired in what seemed a green
baize skirt, very short; worked zephyr slippers with
thick soles, quite new and very large, over gray knitted
worsted stockings, also apparently new. Over the skirt
she wore a clean cotton camisole or sacque. Evidently
Marta was dressed with strict attention to her début in
a new place, and was satisfied that her slippers were as
attractive as they were no doubt comfortable.</p>

<p>Molly wanted to know exactly what was in the kitchen
closets, so that she might see what she had to work with,
therefore she had set Marta to clean them out, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Mrs. Winfield had left everything in such excellent order
that it was not absolutely necessary this first day.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock, and Molly, although she had
laughed at Harry’s anxiety to eat bread and cheese, had
decided that it would be best to have a luncheon that
would be as little trouble as possible, yet one that should
not seem at all a makeshift, so sensitive was she to
Harry’s good-natured criticism.</p>

<p>She ordered in the morning what she thought might
be a month’s supplies of groceries, and for the day’s
use:</p>



<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Milk had been left at the house by Mrs. Winfield’s
man, and ice also, and bread by the baker.</p>

<p>She intended to have for lunch to-day chicken salad,
omelette and drop biscuit and coffee, all of which could,
she knew, be prepared in three quarters of an hour, so
she helped Marta dust and replace the utensils in their
places, and made notes of what was lacking for her use,
although, as economy was her object, she decided to do
with as little addition to what was in the house as possible.</p>

<p>She called Marta’s attention as they replaced each article,
telling her its English name, and bidding her remember
its place and keep it there.</p>

<p>Marta spoke no English, but Molly spoke fair German,
and she managed to make her understand. As the
clock struck twelve, Molly took her into the dining-room
to lay the luncheon cloth; she showed her how it must
be done, that the fold must be just in the centre, the salt-cellars
always neat and smooth, a soiled knife never put
on, and as she went through these necessary instructions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the thought crossed her mind, how frivolous and
useless these little niceties must seem to a girl to whom
perhaps even a table-cloth had hitherto been an unknown
luxury. What wonder that it was in these
small things so difficult to train one?</p>

<p>When the table was ready, Molly ran into the little
garden, and gathered a few red geranium flowers and
their leaves, and arranged them in a glass for the centre
of the table.</p>

<p>“This is one of the charms of the country; even in a
tiny garden like this, one can always have a spray of
flowers for the table,” thought Molly.</p>

<p>It was now a quarter past twelve, and one thing that
Marta must be taught was punctuality. At one o’clock
lunch was to be, and as Molly would prepare it to-day,
it should not be a minute behind.</p>

<p>“Come, Marta, I want to show you how to make biscuit;
but first we must look to the fire.”</p>

<p>Molly had made it herself before Marta arrived, and
knew it was good and the oven hot, but she wanted to
impress on her handmaiden the necessity of assuring
herself that it was good, before beginning to cook.</p>

<p>“I set the damper this way, so that the oven would
heat as soon as the fire is burning well, Marta. You see
it is hot, and also,” taking off the stove lid, “that there is
fire enough to last; always make sure of that, so that
you will not find yourself with a poor fire in the middle
of cooking.”</p>

<p>This Molly managed to convey by words and actions,
and Marta nodded comprehension.</p>

<p>“Now then, as we are such a small family, I take a
pint of flour only, and a scant dessert-spoonful of butter,
and rub it in the flour this way, do you see? until it is
just like sand. Now I add a salt-spoonful of salt, two
tea-spoonfuls of sugar, and a small tea-spoonful of baking-powder;
be very careful of the proportions, for it is just
by doing this that you are sure never to have days when
things turn out wrong; they cannot do that, if <i>you</i> are
exact and right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now mix all thoroughly, and you see I take this
scant half pint of milk; I make a hole in the flour and
pour it partly in, stirring as I do it, and if I see it needs
more in order to keep it the stiffest kind of batter or
the softest kind of dough, I add it; it takes all the half
pint, you see, but with flour you can’t be quite sure of
the exact quantity, and a tea-spoonful too much would
make it too thin. Now, you see, it is so very thick I can
hardly stir it, yet it is far from being stiff enough to
knead. Butter that tin pan and give it to me.”</p>

<p>Marta understood the order, but began slowly to
spread butter from the end of a knife. Molly took a
bit of white paper, and taking the pan from her quickly,
for the biscuit had now to be got into the oven as soon
as possible, she rubbed a bit of butter over it.</p>

<p>“Too many cooks spoil the broth, Marta. If I had
been working quite alone I should have greased my pan
before beginning; it is very bad management to leave
it.” As she spoke she was taking the paste on the end
of her spoon, and dropping it in little oblong mounds on
the pan, about two inches apart. In another minute
they were in the oven, which was very hot.</p>

<p>“My mother used to pride herself on these biscuits,
and gave herself fifteen minutes to make and bake
them. Now for the salad.”</p>

<p>Molly quickly opened the can of chicken she had
bought, and cut the contents in half; one portion she
turned out on a dish, and set the other aside to go into
the ice-box. Then she set Marta to open olives and salad
oil, while she herself cut the chicken into small pieces,
removing every bit of skin that was on it. When the
olives were open, she took a small, sharp, knife and calling
Marta’s attention to an olive, she cut into it till the
edge of the knife touched the stone, and then began to
peel that stone, as it were, being careful not to break the
peel, and keeping close to the stone. When the knife
had passed all around, the stone was in her left thumb
and finger, the peel or stoned olive in her right. The
stone was bare except at the ends, and the olive peel
curled back into its old form, minus those ends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Marta, see if you can stone six olives as I did
that. Never mind if you break the first.”</p>

<p>Molly saw Marta start right, then she poured out a
table-spoonful of oil and a half one of vinegar, a salt-spoonful
of salt, and a scant half one of pepper. These
she mixed thoroughly and poured over the chicken, taking
care that it should go well through it. Then she
looked into the oven. The biscuits had been in five minutes;
they had puffed up and were nearly done.</p>

<p>When first the groceries had come, Molly, mindful of
her mayonnaise, had put an egg, bowl, and spoon in the
ice-box, and, had the day been hot, she would have put
the oil there too. She went for them now, and knew
that the minute it took her to get them had sufficed to
give the biscuit just the tint she wanted, a pale golden
brown; she took them out and set them in the warming-closet
of the range, and returned to her salad. She
wanted Marta to wash the lettuce, but having set her to
stone olives was careful not to take her from that task.</p>

<p>“My bad management,” she thought. “I ought to
have set her to wash the lettuce, and leave it drying in
a cloth while she did the olives.”</p>

<p>Marta had managed to cut three or four olives into
small pieces, but had evidently not seized the idea.
Molly stoned another one for her, and then Marta once
more began.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I want you to stone those and then to
wash the lettuce, putting each leaf on a clean cloth as
you do it. I am going to make a mayonnaise sauce,
which I must show you another day.”</p>

<p>She broke the egg, putting the white into a cup, the
yolk into her ice-cold bowl, and began to stir it. This
she did for a few seconds, and then added a few drops of
oil, stirred just long enough for it to disappear in the
yolk, then added a very little more, and so on, stirring
steadily, waiting till the last oil was blended before adding
more. When it had once assumed the pale opaque
yellow that told her the mayonnaise had “come,” she
added oil in rather larger quantities. Five minutes after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
this point the mayonnaise was as thick as butter in
warm weather; a little more oil and it could no longer
be stirred, for it clung to the spoon.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, you see when it gets like this I add a
few drops of vinegar, which changes the color,—whitens
it,—but stirring a few seconds blends the vinegar, and
it now is like very thick cream. I can go on adding oil
now till it is very thick again.”</p>

<p>When it had again reached the unmanageable point
Molly put to it, gradually, a half dessert-spoonful of vinegar
(which she had ordered to be very strong), a salt-spoonful
of salt, and a very little white pepper; she
then tasted it and found it would stand a few drops
more vinegar for Harry’s taste, as he liked it rather
sharp.</p>

<p>Marta had finished the olives fairly well, and had the
lettuce drying on the cloth.</p>

<p>“Grind two table-spoonfuls of coffee, Marta. Wait,
I’ll tighten the screw of the mill, while you put that
French coffee-pot on the back of the stove to get
warm.”</p>

<p>Molly placed the dry end of the cloth over the lettuce
leaves and patted them, resolving that a salad-basket
must be an immediate purchase. She took the leaves,
now free from water, and laid them over the salad-dish,
reserving the whitest for the border; then she placed
the chicken in the centre, mixing with it the pieces of
olive Marta had broken in her first attempts, and smoothing
it with a knife</p>

<p>The mayonnaise would have been all the better if it
could have stood in the ice-box half an hour; and,
another time, she would have it made early on the day
it was wanted; however, it was thick enough to mask
the chicken, only less would have answered the purpose
had it been ice cold. She spread it with a knife evenly,
then laid the stoned olives around at intervals—and
the salad was ready.</p>

<p>The coffee being ground, she gave the salad to Marta
to take to the ice-box for the twenty minutes that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
elapse before lunch-time, while she broke three eggs
and separated them, and when Marta returned gave her
the whites to beat to a high froth. While she was doing
that, Molly got the frying-pan, put a table-spoonful
of butter in it, and set both to get hot; then she poured
boiling water through the coffee-pot (in case it might
not have been used lately), threw it out, and put two
full table-spoonfuls of coffee (ground much finer than
the grocer does it, being, in fact, about like coarse corn
meal) into the fine strainer, replaced the coarse one
over it, and then took a tin pint measure, filled it with
boiling water, and poured half into the coffee-pot; the
other half she set on the stove to keep at boiling-point,
while the first dripped through; then she put half a pint
of milk to boil, and, seeing the butter was melted, she
drew back the frying-pan that it might not burn till the
omelette was ready.</p>

<p>Marta had not yet reached the point of snow with the
whites of eggs, and Molly took them from her to finish
herself.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, put that little fringed napkin on the
dish, and with a fork take up those biscuits.”</p>

<p>She watched her while she performed her task, dropping
two or three on the floor, of course, but that did
not ruffle Molly’s good temper, for she knew the girl
could not have been accustomed to doing things daintily,—that
if she followed her instinct, it would no doubt be
to tumble them all out pell-mell together.</p>

<p>“Now take those to the table, set them on the mat I
showed you, and come back at once.”</p>

<p>The eggs were now ready, and as the omelette was to
be the very last thing cooked, she poured the rest of the
water on the coffee, told Marta to get the waiter ready,
and then pour the boiling milk into the pitcher and set
it on it.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, take the chicken salad into the dining-room,
and at the same time take the melon from the ice-box
and bring it here as you come back.”</p>

<p>The coffee had now all dripped through; she took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cup and poured it full of coffee, and then poured it back
to run through again,—then she directed Marta to cut
the melon in half, remove the seeds, and lay the halves
in a dish with a piece of ice in each half. Knowing
Marta would not understand cracking ice, Molly had
put some ready, when she had gone for the bowl and
egg for mayonnaise.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I will run up stairs and get ready for
lunch; while I am gone take the melon into the dining-room
and put it on the table at the side opposite the biscuit.
Remember, at <i>luncheon</i> everything may go on the
table at once. The butter is ready on a dish in the ice-box;
place that, and by that time I will be down.”</p>

<p>Molly had worn a homespun walking-dress, and it had
been the custom of herself and friend, Mrs. Welles, to
try and emulate the neatness of the teacher at the cooking-school
they had attended, who dressed handsomely,
wore no apron, and left her class spotless. They had
attained to great neatness, but Molly found herself more
comfortable in a large apron. She did not yet remove
it, but put on a clean collar, arranged a stray curl, and
washed her face and hands, then ran down to finish her
omelette. She put the frying-pan back to a hot place,
stirred the yolks of eggs with a good pinch of salt and a
little pepper, and mixed them gently with the whites,
and poured both into the pan, which she turned about
that the mixture might run into every part; and when
it was “set” underneath, she lifted one side, tilted the
pan and allowed the uncooked custard to run into its
place; this she kept on doing, always turning the cooked
part toward the centre, until in three minutes it was a
light custard-like mass; then, with a cake-turner, she
folded one side over and slipped the doubled omelette on
to a hot dish, where it lay, a delicate golden-brown mound.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, take in the coffee and milk.”</p>

<p>She heard Harry coming down stairs, and looking at
the clock saw it was three minutes past one.</p>

<p>“Going up to dress did that,” she thought, “but it is
not so bad, yet I am sorry Marta has the bad example.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Odors of Araby the blest!” quoted Harry, as Molly,
divested of her apron, the omelette in hand, followed
him into the dining-room. “I smell coffee!—real aromatic
coffee!”</p>

<p>He stood and surveyed the pretty lunch table, looked
at the Delmonico-like salad, the Frenchy omelette, and
then at Molly.</p>

<p>“Humph, is this all cooking-school, or is it part caterer,—if
there is such a being in Greenfield?”</p>

<p>“It is part cooking-school, and a tiny bit Molly,” said
the young wife. “No, indeed, I have no acquaintance
with caterers.”</p>

<p>“This omelette should not palpitate its excellence
away; shall I help you, dear?”</p>

<p>“No; I devote myself to salad”—then to Marta,
who was waiting, uncertain what to do:</p>

<p>“Marta, go into the kitchen and wash up, in quite
hot water, the soiled pans and dishes.”</p>

<p>“Molly, this omelette is perfect; you have put forth
your strength, indeed; but, my dear little girl, I am not
going to have you spend all your time in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to, but I can give a couple of hours
each day, and it will do me good.”</p>

<p>“But this luncheon is quite elaborate. Oh, I’ve
heard of chicken salad and its intricacy, before now.”</p>

<p>Molly smiled; she had known it too. “I will take
some of it if you please.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Molly, I believe it’s worth while to give up
boarding and to live on cold meat, to have such coffee as
this, and such biscuit!”</p>

<p>“I think it is, although I don’t intend to live on cold
meat; I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“But I suppose we must do a good deal of that, or
eat quantities of hash, for we can’t afford to throw our
cold meat away.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Harry, what would be the good of my devotion
to cooking-schools if I couldn’t do better than that?”</p>

<p>“If you learned to make chicken salad there, I swear
by them forever.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll forswear your ridicule, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I will, indeed, if only for the sake of this salad;
there’s a tang, a something about it, that outdoes my
previous conception of the dish. Now, Molly, eliminate
yourself from the cooking-schools, and tell me which
was the ‘tiny bit of Molly.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, Molly was the ‘something’ in the salad—and
also what made it a very easy instead of a difficult dish
to prepare. You have eaten, before, salad made of
boiled or roast chicken. I made this of canned chicken,
which saves all trouble of preparing, and is besides of
far better flavor, for the jelly and all the goodness is
sealed up in the can, instead of escaping into the water.
I don’t like boughten canned things, usually, but the
chicken is a success.”</p>

<p>“The salad was, at any rate. Now I’m going to
smoke; shall we survey our domain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be out in one minute, when I have shown
Marta how to clear away.”</p>

<p>Harry left the room and Marta answered the bell.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, bring your tray, set it on that table
and put these things on it.”</p>

<p>Molly, as she spoke, smoothed over the salt-cellars
with a spoon, then put them away; also the napkins,
while Marta removed the dishes, etc.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, never take off the cloth to shake it,
but do as you see me do now.”</p>

<p>Molly had taken a folded napkin, and brushed the
crumbs lightly into the crumb-pan.</p>

<p>“At dinner do this after the meat is removed. Now
take the cloth by this centre fold, lift it from the table,
lay it back double, and then fold again in the old
creases, till it is just as it left the laundress. At dinner
you shall do it yourself under my direction.”</p>

<p>Molly then went out to join Harry in the little garden.
She had her trunks to unpack, and contents to
arrange in the bureau drawers, but she meant to devote
half an hour to her husband, on this first day of their
home life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Molly, my dear, I begin to think I like housekeeping.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would, Harry, but remember we have
only just begun, and hitches will come sometimes, but
even at the worst that need be, with moderate care, I
think you would not go back to our one room again, and
the routine meals.”</p>

<p>“No; I begin to feel some of the aspirations of proprietorship,
and to wish this little place were mine.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad, Harry, because if you go on thinking
so, in spring we can get a similar place of our own.”</p>

<p>When they had walked and talked till Harry said he
was going in to write letters, Molly returned to the
house, and found Marta in grand confusion washing
glasses, silver, and greasy dishes all together.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marta! I must show you a better way than that.
Take those things out of the dish-pan. Get clean hot
water and a little soap, so. Now take glasses first; roll
them round and put them in this empty dish-pan. Now
the silver. Put the greasy dishes in, and leave them
while you pour nearly boiling water over the silver and
glass. Now bring the waiter and wipe each article as it
comes out of that hot water. You see it takes only a
minute; being hot they hardly dampen the cloth.</p>

<p>“Now set those dry things on a tray, and wash the
greasy dishes, using more soap if the water does not
lather; slip each dish into this hot water, and wipe them
out of it directly; don’t drain them, and then wipe
them half cold.”</p>

<p>When she had thus straightened Marta out, and set
her to make up the fire and sweep the kitchen, she went
up to her unpacking and other arrangements.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Winfield</span> had given Molly some useful information
about her neighbors, and one item was that she
could get cream from one, and salad and fresh vegetables
from another. She had resolved to have a very
simple dinner for to-day, although she knew it would be
more expensive than a better-seeming one, where she
could make good cooking count for half the money.</p>

<p>She had ordered, on her way to the house, a fore-quarter
of lamb weighing eight pounds, and at four
o’clock she went down to see to the fire. Before going
up-stairs she had put on coals and closed all dampers;
now she showed Marta how to rake it, and how to arrange
the dampers so that the fire would draw, and the
oven get hot; then she left the kitchen, telling Marta, as
she had everything tidy down-stairs, she could go to her
room and put some of her belongings in place.</p>

<p>Molly was now feeling glad of rest, for her unpacking
and unwonted standing had tired her, and, thinking
she might indulge herself, she took a book and lay down
on the sofa. Half an hour she lay thus, enjoying the
repose and her book far more than when she had had unlimited
opportunity for both.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! what magic is this? Our new housekeeper
finds time on ‘moving day’ to lie down and improve her
mind,” cried Harry, as he came into the room and sat
down by her side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“I could have found plenty to do, although coming
into a ready-furnished house, left in such perfect order
as this was, really leaves one little, the first day, but to
shake down into place and plan what one can do to-morrow.
I have unpacked, put our own knick-knacks
about up-stairs, and then I felt tired enough to lie down,
and thought it wise to do so before I was over-tired.”</p>

<p>“Of course it was. I have been looking about me
out-of-doors, ordered a paper to be sent, and priced a
brood of chickens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, not yet, Harry! we’ll see about chickens
when we are settled, unless, indeed, you want them
badly.”</p>

<p>“I? No, indeed! I thought of you.”</p>

<p>“Then I would rather wait. I see some cabbages
down at the end of the garden. I have longed to taste
nice cabbage for months.”</p>

<p>“You vulgar little person!”</p>

<p>“You won’t say so when you eat it.”</p>

<p>“No, but I shan’t eat it, my dear. I’ve too much
respect for my digestion.”</p>

<p>“What a pity!”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Harry’s determination, Molly went
for a cabbage, and told Marta to put it in water. Then
Molly took the fore-quarter of lamb, and with a sharp
knife she made a deep incision, just where the neck ends
and the shoulder begins, carrying the knife round nearly
in a circle, always cutting as deeply as possible until
the shoulder was free from the quarter. She had now
before her the breast and rack, or ribs, the scrag, and
the shoulder,—a nice, neat joint. All she had allowed
the butcher to do to the quarter was to joint the chops
and crack the breast across in the usual way, <i>but not to
touch the shoulder</i>.</p>

<p>Molly had seen this process of removing the shoulder
so often in Europe (where it is a very choice joint),
that she had felt sure she could manage it. She knew
that the great thing was to have the shoulder as <i>thick</i> as
possible, therefore the knife must cut to the rib bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and yet that the circle traced by the knife should go
only within three inches of the edge on the rib side or
back, and follow the line of the breast on the front, so
that there remained five or six rib chops with the fat
upon them, and several from under the shoulder up to
the scrag, which would be excellent “French chops,”
ready trimmed,—she would only have to scrape the
bone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="379" height="304" alt="Cuts of meat" />
</div>

<p>To-day, however, she only separated the breast and
cut off three rib chops, and trimmed them ready for
breakfast, then put them away with the meat, leaving the
shoulder out for dinner. It weighed about three and a
half pounds, and would take, being lamb, which must be
so well done, an hour and a quarter to cook. She set
Marta to peel half a dozen potatoes of medium size,
while she set the shoulder on a wire stand in a dripping-pan,
then shook a <i>little</i> flour over it and rubbed a little
salt on the skin. Molly had profited too well by her
cooking-school lessons to think of putting salt on the
flesh of meat before cooking, when it would draw out the
gravy. When the potatoes were peeled and washed,
she put them in the dripping-pan under the meat, and
for fear enough fat should not drop from the joint to
prevent the potatoes from becoming hard and dry before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they browned, she laid the scraps of fat she had
cut from the breakfast chops upon them. It was both
young and fat lamb,—had it not been, Molly would not
have risked the strong taste of lamb that is nearly mutton,
on potatoes, nor the hard, whitish dryness of those
cooked under lean meat.</p>

<p>The potatoes were well sprinkled with salt and the
pan set in the oven. Molly had only intended having
the lamb, and cut-up peaches and cream for dessert,
yet, seeing she had time, for it was just a quarter to five
now, and only the cloth for Marta to lay, and the cabbage
to cook, she thought she would give Harry some
of his beloved macaroni as a course. She therefore
broke a few pipes of macaroni into pieces about six
inches long, taking a dozen of them, and set them on to
boil in water and a little salt till tender. While this
was in process, she had sent Marta for some tomatoes
from the vine, and when they came, showed her
how to scald them, and herself squeezed the pulp from
two large ones through a strainer, and set it in a small
thick saucepan with a table-spoonful of butter, a salt-spoonful
of salt, and a little pepper, and put it on the
stove where it would slowly cook.</p>

<p>Marta had scalded half a dozen tomatoes and dropped
them, as she skinned them, on some cracked ice. Molly
took them when they were cold and firm, and with a
sharp knife cut them into slices and set them in the ice-box.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, come with me to set the dinner-table.
I will show you, to-night, and expect you to remember
afterwards. You first remove the cover and fold it, but
leave on this white baize.”</p>

<p>Molly watched to see if the girl had remembered her
instructions at lunch, but found she had not retained one
idea.</p>

<p>“No, Marta, the middle fold, lengthwise, and exactly
in the centre; now the flowers, now a plate to each person,
the napkin to the left with a piece of bread in it, a
large and a small knife, two forks and a spoon to each person;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
above these the glasses and a butter-plate.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now
put this carving-napkin in front of Mr. Bishop, lay the
large table-mat there, and when you bring in the meat
set the dish upon it. Now count the dishes and set a
mat for each, one salt-cellar and pepper-caster at each
right-hand corner, two table-spoons at the same place.
Now that is all, and you can come and peel peaches.”</p>

<p>Molly heard the meat in the oven sputtering and hissing,
and found it browning nicely. She basted it, turning
the potatoes over, and closed the oven. It was twenty
minutes past five.</p>

<p>“Marta, I want you to pay attention to everything I
do, because the next time we have this dinner I shall
expect you to cook it alone, and when you have learnt
to roast one piece of meat properly, you will be able to
roast any other. Remember the rules,—your oven
must be quite hot when the meat goes in; if, after a
while, you find danger of its burning, cool it, but meat
can’t get brown too quickly to retain the juices. You
must put no water in the pan, for that steams it. If
your meat is so very lean that it will be dry, it is of
such poor quality that you should not try to roast it
(and that sort of meat you will not have to cook for
me), or it is a part unsuitable for roasting, and should be
cooked some other way. Baste often, and when meat is
half done,—that is, brown and crisp on top,—turn it
over, as I shall do that lamb in a few minutes. Above
all things, meat must be <i>brown</i> if roasted.”</p>

<p>Marta had peeled the eight peaches Molly had given
her, and the latter now told her to three parts fill a
gallon saucepan with water from the kettle, which she
had taken care to see full when she set the oven to heat,
and which was now boiling.</p>

<p>“Put it in the hottest spot, Marta; we want it to boil
quickly. Now that cabbage: it is only a small head, so
you can cut it in four, and remove the outer leaves,—also
cut away the core; wash it thoroughly in two waters; now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hold the colander in your left hand, and as you wash
the cabbage through the second water lay it in it; then
pour the water out of the pan and set the colander in it,
so that all water may run off the cabbage; the thing we
want is to check the boiling water as little as possible,
which the cabbage, filled with cold water, would do.
Now I am going to turn the meat over, so that the under
side will brown, while you pour the water off that macaroni;
it is just tender but not breaking.”</p>

<p>The lamb was brown and crisp on the top when Molly
turned the under side up, so that it might become equally
so. Marta brought the macaroni back to the stove, and
Molly poured over it the tomato juice she had put to reduce.
There was enough to moisten the macaroni and
yet leave a little in the saucepan. She put it at the
back of the stove, where it would keep about boiling-point,
but not burn.</p>

<p>“Now the cabbage, Marta. You see this water is
boiling <i>very fast;</i> put it in gently, so that if there is too
much in the saucepan you may dip some out before it
overflows,—no, it all goes in, and the water covers it
well; now put in one table-spoonful of salt and one
<i>scant</i> salt-spoonful of baking soda. Remember, Marta,
cabbage must never be allowed to remain long in hot
water before it boils up; it must boil <i>very fast;</i> for that
reason it must always be in the hottest part of the stove,
and there must be <i>abundance</i> of water and the saucepan
always large. As soon as it comes back to the boiling-point,
take off the cover, and leave it off all the while, and
push the cabbage down under the water from time to
time. The whole secret of boiling cabbage <i>without filling
the house with a bad odor</i> and sending to table a
vulgar, yellow, wilted vegetable, full of dyspepsia, is to
remember—<i>rapid boiling, plenty of water, plenty of
room, and the cover off</i>.”</p>

<p>She took off the stove-lid as she spoke, and brightened
the top of the fire, and in another minute the cabbage
was “galloping.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minutes from now it will be done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Now, Marta, I want you to run to that white house
across the lot, and ask for half a pint of cream.”</p>

<p>The peaches were cut up, and Molly put them in a
bowl and set it <i>on</i> the ice. When she came back she
grated a small piece of cheese, about as big as her thumb,
and shook it into the macaroni, shaking the saucepan
about, so that it would mix without breaking the pipes,
and set it back to keep hot.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done now till the cabbage
was cooked.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly remembered something she had forgotten,
and stopped short, very much vexed.</p>

<p>“I have no cake to eat with the peaches, and Harry
is so fond of cake! I’ve just time to make a ‘fifteen
minutes’ cake,’ and I will. No, <i>I wont!</i> it will make
getting dinner on time a scramble; I shall go in flushed
and heated, and Harry will think I am killing myself,
and Marta will think she may scramble ever after. We
will do without cake.”</p>

<p>Marta returned with the cream, which was put in the
ice-box, and she was then set at chopping the leaves of
some mint for mint sauce. Molly had found, on walking
around Greenfield the first day they visited the house, a
quantity of mint growing near, and had pulled a few
roots and replanted them in the garden. When it was
chopped quite fine, she took one table-spoonful, an equal
quantity of sugar, and as the vinegar was very strong,
she used one table-spoonful of it and one of water, poured
them over the mint and stirred it till the sugar was dissolved.</p>

<p>Marta, meantime, had put the plates and dishes to
warm, and Molly sent the mint sauce to the table.</p>

<p>“Marta, you will need, to dress the cabbage, a little
milk, a table-spoonful of butter, and a large tea-spoonful
of flour. Make the flour and butter to a paste with the
end of a knife. When I take up the meat, you pour
the cabbage, which I see will be done in a few minutes,
into the colander; the leaves are like marrow now, but
the stalk is a little hard; when it is in the colander, press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it with a plate to get every drop of water out, and put
it back into the pot, with butter and flour, a scant salt-spoonful
of salt, a little white pepper, and half a <i>tea-cupful</i>
of milk. You must remember, too, that when I
am not here to help you dish the dinner, you must put
your meat in the oven five minutes sooner; it can be
taken up before the vegetables, but on no account must
you take up vegetables first, and let <i>them</i> wait. Never
put them on too soon. Now put the warm dishes on the
table in the order in which they will be needed; the meat-platter
first, the vegetable-dishes next. The macaroni
you will bring in after I ring for you to take out the
meat,—I mean, you will take away the meat and vegetables,
then bring in the macaroni and fresh plates, and
after that, the tomatoes, as a salad; and, last of all, the
fruit and tea. Now go and put the cracked ice on the
table, the pitcher of water, and the butter with a piece
of ice on it, and come quickly back.”</p>

<p>Molly looked again at the macaroni, found a little
liquid still at the bottom of the saucepan, and set it
nearer the fire to cook away, and now left the cover off.</p>

<p>“Marta, the cabbage is done; pour off the water.”</p>

<p>At the same time Molly took the meat out of the
oven, and set it in the pan on the stove; she removed
the crisp brown shoulder to the platter, put the potatoes
round it, and then poured the fat from the corner of the
dripping-pan into a jar very gently and carefully, to
prevent the small quantity of brown sediment there
was from leaving it too, for that was the gravy; when
she could get no more fat from one corner, without letting
the gravy go too, she changed to another, till it
was free from it; she set the pan on the stove and
poured in a cup of water and a pinch of salt; with a
spoon she rubbed the pan in every direction, to get off
the clinging glaze or dried gravy, and then she let the
water boil fast while she looked after Marta and the
cabbage which she was stirring.</p>

<p>“Take a knife, Marta, and cut the cabbage across
several times, and then, when the milk forms a creamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dressing and it all bubbles together, turn it out into the
dish.”</p>

<p>The gravy had in two minutes boiled down enough,—there
was very little from such a small joint; it
was poured through a strainer and, with the meat, put
to keep warm while Molly made tea.</p>

<p>“Turn the cabbage out now, Marta; put the cover
on the dish and take it to the dining-room; then take
the meat and bring in the macaroni when I ask you for
it, but you can put it in the dish ready, and keep it hot.
When all is ready, put on a white apron, which I hung
for you behind the door, and tell Mr. Bishop, whom I
see in the garden, that dinner is ready.”</p>

<p>Molly had dressed herself in the afternoon and only
needed to run up-stairs to remove traces of her work.
As the clock struck six she heard Marta carrying in
dinner, and got down herself in time to tell Harry it
was served.</p>

<p>“What joint may this be, my dear?” Harry asked
when seated.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is the English delicacy, a ‘shoulder of
lamb.’ Don’t you remember Sam Weller’s ‘shoulder
of mutton and trimmings’ at the ‘Swarry?’ There is
a particular way to carve it, which my mother used to
be very particular about. I can only describe it by
saying, you cut it like a leg, and there is the same reason
for beginning at the right side,—on one side you
can cut only a shallow gash and a meagre slice, on the
other a deep one,—therefore, till you are familiar with
the joint, prod for the bone with your fork and make
one deep cut to the centre on the side where the meat is
thickest.”</p>

<p>Harry did “prod,” and then, planting his fork, stood
the joint on its side and made one cut, and the joint
yawned as if a wedge had been cut out.</p>

<p>“There is a mythical anecdote about a lady starving
herself to death on shoulder of mutton.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, she chose that joint every day and merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
made that cut, so that when it left the table it looked
as if a meal had been eaten from it, and no one commented
on her abstinence from food. Thank you, I
will take the dish gravy.”</p>

<p>“I approve of shoulder of lamb decidedly,” said
Harry, during dinner.</p>

<p>“I am glad, for, though our English cousins look on
it as far more choice than the leg, and pay more for it,
it is sold here at a much lower price.”</p>

<p>“But what vegetable may this be?” he asked, looking
curiously at the pale green, appetizing cabbage.
“Cauliflower, I suppose, that has met with disasters?”</p>

<p>“No, it is cabbage, and I want you to eat and see if
it is not good.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me cabbage has been cooked
in this house to-day?”</p>

<p>“You see it.”</p>

<p>“And we are not choked! Molly, I surrender; you
are a magician!”</p>

<p>In short, Molly’s dinner was a success, and Harry no
longer looked on cabbage as unfit for a “cultured palate.”</p>

<p>While Harry smoked his pipe on the piazza, after
dinner, Molly went over her accounts. Her grocer’s
bill, for what she supposed would be a month’s stores,
was as follows:—</p>

<p>There were several things, such as soap, starch, flour,
and sugar, Molly would have liked to buy in large quantities,
but she wanted first to see her expenditure; she
reckoned that what she had ordered of each article would
last a month, and a few things, such as vinegar, bluing,
sauce, wine, etc., much longer. “But I must wait till
the end of the week before I can really know. The first
week or month is always more expensive in housekeeping.
I must add, too, to my expenditure, to-day, ten
cents for cream, which will make it $3, but I have meat
in the house, and if I allow one-fourth of the grocery
bill for this week I have left $4.50.”</p>

<p>Molly was not without her anxieties that she might
be wrong on her estimates, often as she had gone over
them on paper. Suddenly she looked up. “I forgot
the yeast, and I want to make bread!”</p>

<small>BREAD-MAKING—BREAKFAST—BAKED POTATOES—CORN
MUFFINS—BREADED CHOPS—HOW TO FRY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly made the humiliating discovery that she
had forgotten the yeast, Harry, who was smoking and
reading, looked up.</p>

<p>“What shall I do, that baker’s bread is so sour?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, let’s sally forth and get it! It’s a
lovely night!”</p>

<p>“Would you?” exclaimed Molly, brightly.</p>

<p>“Why not? You don’t suppose you are going to
monopolize all the merits and reap all the glory of this
housekeeping, do you? Why, I should not be able to
have one of the little jokes other married men seem to
enjoy at their wife’s expense.”</p>

<p>“I hate such jokes,” said Molly; “they are so cheap,
and generally unjust.”</p>

<p>“Then I promise I won’t make them. I’ll never
boast of the servant girls I escort out from New York,
nor of the baskets I carry, nor the”—</p>

<p>“You’ll have no chance if you respect the truth,”
said Molly, laughing. “Now if we are going, I’ll put
on my things.”</p>

<p>The little town of Greenfield was just venturing on
electric lights, and, with the band of its skating-rink
making music, had quite a dissipated appearance, as the
young couple strolled around in search of a grocer, and
Molly, at the same time, found out a few other facts she
was anxious to know, and had not yet had time to discover.</p>

<p>As they walked home, Harry said, hesitating, “My
dear, I don’t want to interfere with your housekeeping,
and I feel my own insignificance in approaching such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
subject, but I would diffidently suggest that our family
is at present very small, and neither you nor I like stale
bread. Do you think Marta can be induced to consume
all the ‘left over’ loaves?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t you think we had better try another
baker who doesn’t make sour bread, or”—this was
said very slowly, as if it would be a sad necessity—“I
might bring it out from New York.”</p>

<p>Molly laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“I think I see you! Surely then you could joke
about your martyrdom. No, my dear boy, you’re going
to have no such toothsome morsel as that for a joke,
but I see you are afraid of stale bread.”</p>

<p>“The truth is, I have a lively recollection of living in
the country and eating bread a week old, and older still
sometimes, when the general appetite failed, and I
don’t believe I’m up to that sort of thing now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are, so you will not be tested.
Now-a-days one doesn’t fear baking as one used to do.
It is no more trouble to make bread three times a
week than to boil potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to hear it. I’m learning every hour
my own benighted ignorance.”</p>

<p>When they reached home Molly went into the kitchen
and put one quarter of the yeast cake in a pint of warm
water, which she made Marta, who was to make the
next bread, feel was just about as warm as milk from
the cow, then she put a heaped quart of flour in the
mixing-bowl and set it in the oven with the door open,
telling Marta to stir it in a few minutes that it might
get evenly warm through.</p>

<p>“I am doing this, Marta, because I do not know this
flour. It may be very new or damp; by drying it I
shall be on the safe side. In cold weather you must
warm it always, so that the water, yeast, and flour are
all about the same temperature.”</p>

<p>When the yeast was quite dissolved by stirring, she
put into the water one tea-spoonful of salt and two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sugar, made a hole in the flour and poured the liquid in,
and the whole made a soft dough which slightly stuck
to her hands.</p>

<p>“If it is necessary just shake in a little flour from the
dredger; never throw it in by the handful, as the less
flour you work with the better.” As Molly spoke she
steadied the bowl with one hand and with the other
worked the dough with her fist from the side to the
middle, so that in five minutes what had been the under
part was all brought over to the top, and the whole was
smooth and very elastic to the touch.</p>

<p>Marta watched with interest and, as Molly could see,
surprise.</p>

<p>“My mother always made her bread thin at night,
and put in more flour in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but your mother and mine had no certainty
that the yeast was good, and it was better to ‘prove it’
by using part of the flour for a sponge than to waste
the whole, but now we use compressed yeast, which we
are <i>sure</i> is good if fresh.”</p>

<p>Marta did not look convinced. She doubtless fancied
it was some new-fangled notion of Molly’s.</p>

<p>The bread was left, covered with a clean cloth, on
the table free from draught, for it was a mild night and
she knew it would be risen well in the morning without
going into a warm spot.</p>

<p>The next morning, as it was Marta’s first, Molly was
up and down-stairs a few minutes after her, and found
she had taken away the ashes and was struggling with
the fire; with Molly’s help, however, it was soon burning
in the stove.</p>

<p>“Now brush off the stove quickly before it gets hot,
and do so every morning, and on Saturday it needs
thorough cleaning.” Molly looked at the bread as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Fill the kettle now, after you pour out the water
left in it, set it in the hole of the stove, and then look
at the bread before I touch it that you may see how it
should be. It is quite light, as you see, more than double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the size it was last night; now while you go and
dust the dining-room, brushing up any crumbs there
may be first, I will work the bread over, then you can
come here and sweep your kitchen and the piazzas.
Molly worked the bread over faithfully for five minutes,—had
the quantity been larger, of course the time
would have been in proportion,—and then she set it in
a warm spot back of the range, and went herself into
the parlor to arrange it, knowing Marta would not be
so quick this first morning as she hoped she might become
later. At seven o’clock the work was done, and
Molly told Marta she must do every morning exactly as
this morning.</p>

<p>“Now we will begin to get breakfast, but I shall let
you do it, because you will see that you have ample
time without my help, and it must always be on the
table at eight o’clock. Bring the chops I prepared yesterday,
two eggs, and three potatoes.”</p>

<p>Molly looked at the fire, found it bright and the oven
hot; she put a shovelful more of coals each side of the
fire, and then showed Marta how to brush the potatoes
with a little new brush she had brought for the purpose.</p>

<p>“See the difference, Marta? Wash them ever so
carefully, you can’t make the skins so clean that the
minute you put the brush to them they do not look several
shades lighter.”</p>

<p>They were put into the oven.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, bring that packet of cracker meal I
pointed out yesterday, and pour at least half on a dish;
now a saucer and the pepper and salt. Break one egg,
and put the yolk into the saucer, the white into a cup;
if there were more chops we would use both white and
yolk,—as there are so few, for economy’s sake we will
use only the yolk; put to it two teaspoonfuls of cold
water and beat it with a fork. Now season those chops
with salt and pepper, remembering never to do so before
cooking if they are to be broiled or cooked without
breading.”</p>

<p>Marta was rather clumsy, but still Molly repressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
her own itching fingers, knowing the girl would do better
in future if let alone now.</p>

<p>“Now lay a chop in the egg,—take care it moistens
every part,—lift it out with the left hand, let it drain
an instant and lay it on the cracker meal; now with
your dry <i>right</i> hand send the meal all over it till every
bit of the meat is covered with the white dust, then lay
it aside. Now do the others in the same way.”</p>

<p>Molly looked at the clock; it was nearly half past
seven.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Marta, get the can of lard, and, as that spider
is not deep, I am going to fry in this agate saucepan; it
is just about broad enough for a chop. Put in it at
least a pound of lard, set it where it will get hot, yet
not boil till you are ready. Now you can grease the
muffin-pans, leaving a teaspoonful of lard in one, and
then make the muffins. We need only a dozen, so you
can take half a cup of corn meal, half a cup of flour,
and a teaspoon of baking-powder and half one of salt.
Mix them quickly. Now a scant table-spoonful of sugar,
and milk to make a thick batter, break in an egg, and
beat it all steadily three minutes by the clock,—no, beat
just as if you were beating eggs, quickly, till it froths.
Now pour the lard from the muffin-pan in it, stir well,
and fill the pans nearly full; set them in the oven,—they
will bake in fifteen minutes. Go now and set the
table, and do it quickly.”</p>

<p>On second thought Molly went with her and helped,
because she could not easily find things. She found
she had remembered fairly well the directions about the
cloth.</p>

<p>“Put the cups and saucers at my left, and that mat
for the meat before Mr. Bishop; the potatoes, on a
folded napkin, you will place on one side, the muffins
exactly opposite them on the other, butter within easy
reach of both. Put this tile for the coffee at my right
hand, the sugar and the milk-pitcher in front, those
geraniums in the centre, a knife and fork and small
plate to each; and now come out into the kitchen, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the plates to warm, and a platter. I’ll put the lard now
on the hottest part of the stove, and a cover over it, so
that the smell of hot grease may be as little as possible,
and while it gets hot you can grind the coffee. You
remember how to make it? Put a pint of milk on to
boil, and set the other pint away. Now try the fat, and
remember that what I am now going to teach you with
these chops applies <i>to all kinds</i> of frying. The way you
crumbed those chops is the way you must crumb cutlets,
fish, oysters, or croquettes. They are better
crumbed a little while before they are fried, as they
have time to dry.”</p>

<p>Molly had cut, as she spoke, some little cubes of
bread.</p>

<p>“Come and watch, Marta. This fat is very hot, but
I doubt if it is hot enough, although it begins to
smoke.”</p>

<p>She dropped in one bit of bread, it sizzled, but after
waiting a few seconds remained white.</p>

<p>“It is not hot enough or that bread would have colored.
Get the colander, set it on the stove with this
sheet of grocer’s paper in it. When you take any fried
article out of the fat, lay it first on the paper, then on a
hot dish. Now let us try the fat again.”</p>

<p>Another bit of bread was dropped into the fat, and
this time it colored in a few seconds.</p>

<p>“Remember, if I had six chops instead of three I
should let the fat get hotter yet, because they would cool
it so much. Now drop each chop gently in,—that’s
the way. If they were very thick, as soon as they
were brown I would draw back the fat, and leave them
longer; as it is, two minutes will brown them beautifully,
and they will be cooked through.”</p>

<p>“Two minutes!” murmured Marta, in expostulating
tones. She could hardly be expected to credit that.</p>

<p>“Yes; you forget this fat is far hotter than any oven
would be, and they are completely immersed in it. You
can take up the potatoes if they are done, wipe them
and lay them on the plate, and I will take up the muffins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The two minutes are up; look at the chops: you see
they are most beautifully brown all over alike!”</p>

<p>Marta exclaimed, “<i>Schön!</i>” and stolidly attentive as
she had been to all else, the golden chops evidently appealed
to some hidden well of enthusiasm. They were
taken up, laid first on the paper, then on the dish, and
put to keep hot while the breakfast was taken to the
table.</p>

<p>When the chops were going in, Molly said, “When
we are settled, I shall want you always to put a little
parsley on the dish with fried things.”</p>

<p>The muffins were light and crisp, the potatoes looked
far more tempting in their pale-yellow, well-brushed
skins than they usually do, and altogether the breakfast
was as dainty a meal as heart could sigh for.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>HOW TO MANAGE THE FAT THAT HAS BEEN USED
FOR FRYING—CUP CAKE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> breakfast was on the table, Molly directed
Marta to go up-stairs with pail and cloth and to bring
down the soiled water, fill the ewer with fresh, etc. As
Harry rose to put on his coat, Molly ran up-stairs and
put on her hat and gloves. “I am going to the depot
with you, Harry,” she said, when she reappeared ready
for walking, “and I shall do my marketing as I return.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea, Molly; the walk will be good
for you.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the house, Molly passed through the
kitchen, and told Marta, after she had finished her breakfast,
to wash the breakfast things, but to leave the fat
(that she had herself removed from the stove and covered,
so that the fumes might not fill the house, before
she went in to breakfast) till she returned. “After you
have washed up, if I am not here, fill the lamps and
clean the chimneys.”</p>

<p>This Marta was doing when she got back, and while
she finished, Molly took off her outdoor clothes and
donned her apron. “Now, Marta, I will show you
about this fat, and I want you to remember to do just
as you see me do, every time you use it. This is a piece
of cheese-cloth; the fat is still quite hot (Molly had left
it on the iron shelf over the range), but not scalding; I
put the cloth over this empty lard-pail, and without
shaking the fat, pour it through the cloth. You see all
this fine black sediment that remains on the cloth and in
the saucepan? That, if it were not strained out, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
discolor whatever you fried in it. When it is strained
each time, you can use it a dozen times; so you see it is
not extravagant to fry in deep fat. Now you have a
very greasy cloth and saucepan, but pour a quart of
<i>boiling</i> water and a piece of washing-soda as big as a
walnut on them, stir them, and you see you have no
more <i>grease</i>, only some nice <i>soapy</i> water and a clean
saucepan!”</p>

<p>Marta’s interest had been all alive since she had seen
the chops, and she explained how often she had seen
cooks in Germany bread cutlets, and they came out of
the pan only breaded here and there. Never had she
seen them all over alike, except at a restaurant where
she had been dish-washer, and where there was a man
cook.</p>

<p>“The crumbs come off for one of two reasons,—either
they were too large (when I use bread instead of cracker
I sift them), or the fat had not been hot enough; two
or three large crumbs would spoil the whole, for they
would fall off, bring others with them, and leave bare
pale spots.”</p>

<p>As she made the explanation she had worked over
the bread, which had risen to twice its first bulk, and put
it into a tin pan, and set it to rise again. “That will
only make one nice loaf, but it is as much as we shall eat
while fresh. Now, while my hands are in flour, I will
make a plain cake, and while it is baking, Marta, you
and I will go up-stairs to the bedrooms. But first look
well at the bread in the pan; you see it is barely half
full; I worked it thoroughly, so that it has again to rise;
when it is twice the size it now is it will be ready for
the oven.”</p>

<p>She got for her cake two eggs, half a cup of butter,
one of sugar, and a cup and a half of flour, a lemon,
a nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of baking-powder. Remembering
she would need them, she had brought half
a dozen of lemons and an ounce of nutmegs in with
her. She set Marta to cream the butter and sugar,
while she separated the yolks of the eggs and beat
the whites till they were quite firm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is only a plain ‘one, two, three, four’ cake,
Marta, but it will be made nicer by the flavoring. When
you know how to make this cake, always remember to
vary the flavor, and the cake will seem much better than
ordinary cup cake; sometimes you can add, the last
thing, a cup of candied lemon and orange peel, cut fine,—I
will show you how to candy them when we have
collected enough,—or a cup of currants; either of these
must be made warm, flour shaken through them, and the
cake stirred only just enough, after they are in, to mix
them, or they will all go to the bottom. This cake we
will flavor with lemon and nutmeg. Mix the two yolks
now with the butter and sugar, grate half the nutmeg,
beginning at the blossom end or there will be a hole all
through it; when you see that, always turn the nutmeg,
begin at the other end, and there will be no hole; then
grate the peel of the lemon to them, add a quarter tea-spoonful
of salt, and mix all together; now sift in part
of the flour with the baking-powder, then part of this
cup of milk, now more flour, and the rest of the milk;
the batter is rather stiff as yet, but the whites of the
eggs will thin it enough,—they are the last to go in.”</p>

<p>Molly buttered a cake-pan, and the mixture, a thickish
batter, was poured in, and then powdered sugar was
sifted over and the cake put in the oven.</p>

<p>“The oven is nice and hot. I like to cover a cake
the first half hour, so I will put this pie-pan over the
top; another time I will have a piece of card-board ready
and keep it for the purpose. Remember, if you want
to make this cake when we are short of butter, you can
use half lard. Now look at the bread; it will be ready
in about twenty minutes, and the oven will be just nice
for it. Meanwhile we will go upstairs.”</p>

<div class="chaptitle">WHAT “SIMMERING” MEANS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> congratulated herself on her unusual good
fortune in securing such a girl as Marta, when she saw,
in initiating her into the bedroom work, how well she did
it. But she was not to be without her trials, even with
this treasure, any more than every other housekeeper.
When she knew, by the time, that the bread was ready,
being deep in the draping of some chintz she had had in
their city room, she told Marta to run down and put it
in the oven, and to take the cover off the cake, but on
no account to <i>move</i> or <i>shake</i> it, as the bread would go
in on the other side of it.</p>

<p>Marta ran down, if the term can be applied to the
lumbering movement with which she hurled herself
down-stairs. Molly heard her carrying out her order,
and then she heard a sound that elicited an exclamation
of annoyance. It was the sound of the oven door closing
with a tremendous bang.</p>

<p>“My poor cake! how vexatious!” For a moment
vexation impelled her to scold Marta, but if Molly was
one thing more than another, she was reasonable. Her
blame was for herself more than for the girl. “How
could she know? I must give her a general caution;
I suppose the cake is gone utterly.”</p>

<p>It was. She met Marta returning to her up-stairs
work smiling serenely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Marta, I want you to come and look at the result of
banging the oven door in that way when cake is in the
oven,—and you must remember, too, never to set a pot
heavily on the range; when a cake has once risen, until
quite done, any sudden jar will cause it to settle down.
Look at this; you see the cake is all sunken.”</p>

<p>Marta stood, the picture of concern, her teeth pressed
tight over her under lip.</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll look on the cake as a lesson;
to-morrow you must make another as you saw me do
this. Go and finish up-stairs, and I think, as we have
no cake to-day, I will make a pie for dinner. When
you come down you will see me make the paste, as everything
I do I hope you will do later.”</p>

<p>When Marta came down Molly weighed out six ounces
of butter and eight ounces of flour—the butter was
straight from the ice-box and very firm; these she put
together in a chopping-bowl with a pinch of salt, opened
the window to let in the cool air, and then chopped butter
and flour together, but not very fine, the butter still
remaining in well-defined bits, some as large as white
beans, when she left off. Making a hole in the centre,
she poured in a <i>small</i> half cup of ice-water, and made it,
with as little pressure as possible, into a firm dough. A
few bits of butter and flour fell from it, but she did not
stay to work them in smoothly, explaining to Marta, as
she turned all out on to the pastry-board, that they
would roll in smooth, and the less handling the pastry
had the better. She rolled it out half an inch thick,
folded it in three, putting any little flakes of butter that
might be on the board upon it, and rolled it out again.
(This was done as quickly as possible, so that the warm air
of the kitchen might not soften the butter.) She dredged
very little flour on it, and folded it again in three, rolled
it again, and then once more folded and rolled it, making
three times in all.</p>

<p>“Now, if I were in a hurry, I should use the pastry
at once, as it is ready, but it will be so much lighter and
better by being put on the ice that I shall leave it till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
come out to see to the dinner. I will have cold lamb
and salad for my lunch,—you know how to prepare the
lettuce.” And Molly left the kitchen, knowing she had
now some hours in which she could attend to getting
things into place, etc.</p>

<p>Hardly was her luncheon cleared away, however,
when Marta brought in a card, saying a lady had given
it to her, but she didn’t know what she wanted. It bore
the name of Mrs. Merit, and realizing that the visitor
was left standing at the front door, Molly hurried out
to receive her. She apologized for Marta’s keeping her
there.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. This is a very early call; but
coming into a furnished house is so different from an
empty one,—you get settled in a few hours; besides, I
knew this was your first experience of housekeeping, and
if one wants to be of real use it is of no use to leave it
till your difficulties are over.”</p>

<p>The lady had followed Molly into the parlor as she
spoke, and seated herself in the rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Molly, thinking how
very friendly it was.</p>

<p>“I mean to be kind, my dear. I know the difficulties
of inexperienced young housekeepers, and I want you to
know that your nearest neighbor is ready to run right in
any time you want, and if there’s anything I can tell
you, why, you know where to come.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much indeed,” said Molly gratefully;
“I shall not forget.”</p>

<p>The conversation now drifted off into talk about
Greenfield, and Molly learned the names of most of her
near neighbors, and, it must be confessed, more of their
peculiarities than she cared to hear.</p>

<p>“I’m your nearest neighbor on this side the street,
but there’s poor Mrs. Lennox right opposite, poor thing!
I’m glad she’s got some one to take Mrs. Winfield’s
place to her. She was a real good neighbor, and when
one’s life’s as hard as hers, a friendly neighbor is a
good deal.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly did not ask why Mrs. Lennox was qualified by
the adjective “poor” nor why her life was hard. She
began to recognize in Mrs. Merit a type of good-hearted
women given over-much to interesting themselves in
other people’s affairs. Mrs. Merit rocked serenely on,
however, and proceeded to question Molly on her knowledge
of housekeeping and to give some strong hints on
economy.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear, young people start off with an
idea of style, and it takes them some time to find out
the best and cheapest way of doing things, and there’s
receipts I’ve got that I’ve altered and changed so’s
they don’t cost half, and taste, to my thinking, just as
well, and no danger of dyspepsia, and I’d be glad to
send you over my written book.”</p>

<p>Again Molly thanked her, and promised to avail herself
of the book.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ll find your money goes a deal further;
my receipts don’t call for eggs and butter as if they
grew out on the bushes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Molly timidly, “we need so little
of anything that even a recipe which calls for what
seems many eggs or much butter can generally be divided
by four for us, and the four eggs or half pound of butter
become only one egg and two ounces of butter; so we
can have the good things and still spend little.”</p>

<p>“But then you have so little of it, and it wastes time
to make things in small quantities.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but my time is not valuable, and besides it
would be no economy for me to make things too plain,
for we might not eat them at all; and the same would
happen if I made much at a time of anything,—it would
not be eaten up. Mr. Bishop likes variety.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> believe in husbands’ liking food that’s according
to their means, and not in young women wearing
their lives out cooking for them. Mr. Merit was always
satisfied with a plain, wholesome dinner, and that I took
care he had.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Merit’s words were verging on the unpleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but her manner was so unconscious that Molly felt sure
only kindness was meant; she was simply instructing
the young and inexperienced wife.</p>

<p>“Now there’s poor Mrs. Lennox, she’s got four children,
and her husband is as poor as a church mouse, and
as pernickety about his eating—nothing she can get is
good enough for him; and the way she manages to make
both ends meet, and to dress them children as nice as any,
is a wonder to every one, though, poor thing, she is
wearing herself out.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, finding Molly was not curious about
Mr. and Mrs. Lennox, Mrs. Merit protested that she
was paying an unwarrantably long visit, rose and left,
saying, as she did so, “You won’t be lonely long, you
are not like strangers; being such friends of Mrs. Winfield,
every one will make a point of calling very soon.”</p>

<p>Molly noticed, as she returned to the parlor, that
Mrs. Merit was standing at the door of the house she
had pointed out as Mrs. Lennox’s; doubtless she had
gone to report her visit.</p>

<p>Molly went from her visitor to the kitchen. She had
ordered in the morning a porterhouse steak and a dozen
oysters on the half shell. As the butcher was also fishmonger,
he had no objection to send so few, and she
had impressed on him that both were to be sent after
five, and the oysters opened at the house. She now
told Marta, when they should come, to put the oysters
into the ice-box at once, and went to assure herself
that the fire was made up and would be ready by five
o’clock to cook. She found, as she had feared, that
Marta had forgotten, and the fire was at that stage of
intense brightness which gives place to a mass of dead
white ash a little later, but would quickly burn up with
fresh fuel.</p>

<p>“How fortunate I came out, Marta; red as this fire
is, in half an hour it would have been near out. Put a
little coal on; when it is lighted well, not before, you
can rake out the ashes and put on more coal, but not
too much.” As she spoke she opened all the drafts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>She meant to have a ragout of the rougher part of the
lamb—the neck piece—as a second dish; if Harry did
not care for it at dinner, it would make a very savory
one for breakfast. She cut it up into neat pieces;
there was about a pound and a half of meat, very lean,
and, properly treated, the tenderest in the whole sheep.</p>

<p>“If I had to pay the same for this part of the lamb as
for the loin, I should still prefer it for boiling and stewing,”
she said to Marta, “but so few people will believe
it. Get me one onion and a carrot, and prepare them.
I wish I had some canned peas, they would be such an
addition; but I have not half the little things in store yet
that I need.”</p>

<p>Molly was making this ragout, not that it was needed
for dinner so much, although it made variety and a better-seeming
table, but her chief thought was for the breakfast.
Having the vegetables prepared, and the range
being by this time hot on the top, she put a spider, containing
a table-spoonful of butter and one of flour, on the
stove, and told Marta to stir slowly till the flour and butter
were pale brown, while she tied six sprigs of parsley
and half a bay leaf together. When the flour and butter
formed a smooth brownish paste, or <i>roux</i>, as the
cooking-books call it, the carrots and onions, cut small,
and the meat were added, with a half salt-spoonful of
pepper, three level salt-spoonfuls of salt, and a tea-spoonful
of vinegar. These were all stirred round, and a
close cover put on.</p>

<p>“Now these have to be stirred every minute or so, to
prevent burning, till brown, and while the ragout is
cooking I will make a lemon pie. I have written the
recipe, Marta, as I shall do all for the future, and you
will keep the book in the kitchen. I will read it over
to you.”</p>

<p>The recipe was, of course, written in German. Molly
had not been able to do it without help from the dictionary,
but she remembered that she was improving her
German, which, indeed, was one of her reasons for taking
a German girl, the compulsory practice would be so
good for herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Half a cup of fine bread crumbs, just enough milk
to swell them, two eggs, three table-spoonfuls of sugar,
two of butter, the juice of one lemon, the grated rinds of
two. Beat sugar and butter to a cream, then the eggs
and lemon juice, and last the bread and milk. You can
make the mixture while I roll the paste and get the pie
ready, but first I’m going to knock a few holes in this
tin pie-plate, so that the crust may be light at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>She took a small nail and hammer, and with it perforated
the pie-plate till it looked like a colander. The
paste was firm and hard, and Molly rolled it out with
perfect ease, the third of an inch thick, without its once
sticking to the board, which was lightly floured. She
laid the pie-plate on it, and cut a circle a little larger
than the tin to allow for the depth. Every touch she
made was quick and light, just as if the paste were tulle
or white satin. She turned the plate over, laid the paste
on it, and pressed it <i>only on the bottom</i>, never touching the
edges. She cut a little piece and put it in the oven to
try it. Then she cut two long strips of paste, about an
inch wide, and laid them lightly around the pie, so as to
make the edge twice the thickness of the bottom; she
gently pressed the <i>lower</i> edge of this strip to make it adhere
to the pie, and then poured in the lemon mixture.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bishop doesn’t like meringue, or I would have
kept out the two whites of eggs, to make it,” said Molly,
as she took out the little “trier” she had in the oven.</p>

<p>It had risen a full inch, and “the separate flakes could
be counted!” Marta exclaimed, as she saw it. Her intelligence
only seemed to rouse when she saw something
out of the ordinary routine of cooking, because, as Molly
afterwards found, her ideal of cooking was what the man
cook at the restaurant in Germany could do; she never
expected to see a lady do them, and he had made puff
paste just like this, and it seemed magic to her.</p>

<p>“And if she had never lived at the restaurant she would
not have had intelligence enough to know what to admire.
It is the old story,—to those who know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of art, a gay chromo is better than a fine painting,” said
Molly, when she told Harry, who broke into good-natured
laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Molly, you are too delicious in your
enthusiasm! What would our artists say to such a comparison?”</p>

<p>Molly joined in the laugh. “It sounds absurd, but
the principle is the same. The poor girls who have no
experience of good cooking or refined living can’t be
expected to appreciate it.”</p>

<p>But this was in the evening, and we are digressing
from the dinner.</p>

<p>By the time the pie was in the oven, the lamb had
been twenty minutes in the spider,—Marta occasionally
stirring it about. Two thirds of a pint of hot water was
now added (it left plenty of gravy around the meat, yet
<i>did not cover it</i>), the parsley was put in, and the spider
closely covered and set where it would <i>just simmer</i>, as
the success of the dish depended on its simmering, and
<i>not</i> boiling. Molly waited to see it come to the boiling-point.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, remember that <i>to simmer</i> means this,”
she said, pointing out the gentlest little sizzling round
the edge of the pan. “Perhaps you hardly think it is
cooking at all, but that scarcely perceptible motion is
what I mean when I say, ‘let it simmer;’ faster than
that would be boiling. You must understand these distinctions
if ever you hope to make a good cook. We are
going to have Lima beans, and stuffed potatoes, and
cheese canapées—to use up the baker’s bread—and,
as I do not mean to be in the kitchen to-night except
just as you broil the steak, I will get everything ready
now.”</p>

<p>So saying, she cut slices of bread half an inch thick,
then, with a large round cutter, cut circles; these she
cut in half—they were not the true crescent shape that
canapées should be, but they would answer; then she
put a table-spoonful of butter in a small saucepan (using
a saucepan, because to fry, or rather sauter, so little, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
butter required would be twice as much if it had to go
over the large space of a frying-pan), and then she fried
four of the canapées a very light brown. When done
she took them up, and grated about an ounce of cheese,
and setting the canapées on a small tin ready for the
oven, she heaped the grated cheese on them, then
sprinkled on them a little pepper and salt.</p>

<p>“Marta, those are ready, but need not go into the
oven till I tell you. At five you wash four large potatoes
and put them into the oven; at a quarter past you
can put the Lima beans into a saucepan of boiling
water, with two tea-spoonfuls of salt and one of sugar;
let them come quickly to the boil again.”</p>

<p>Molly took the pie out of the oven. It was beautifully
brown, and the edge, half an inch thick when it
went into the oven, was now more than double, and
more flaky than real puff paste, as generally made.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I’ll leave you to set the table quite alone
to-night, and to do everything by yourself, except broil the
steak, which I have not yet shown you how to do, and to
dress the vegetables. Chop ready for me two table-spoonfuls
of parsley and one slice of onion very fine.”</p>

<p>Molly had to congratulate herself on having gotten
so far forward with the dinner, for just as she was leaving
the kitchen Mrs. Lennox came.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Merit told me you were settled and ready to
see your neighbors, so I would not delay coming
over. I have not the same good excuse as she has for
so early a visit, for, beyond good feeling, I cannot be of
any use to any one, my hands are so completely tied
with my family; but you are Mrs. Winfield’s friend,
and you seem no stranger to me.”</p>

<p>“But no excuse is needed,” said Molly. “I think it
exceedingly kind.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox was a very nervous-looking woman, who
had once been very pretty, and was still young enough
to be so. When they had talked a little while, it
proved that one of Molly’s dear friends had been a
school-fellow of Mrs. Lennox. This made them quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
intimate in a few minutes, and Molly found herself talking
freely of her hopes and plans.</p>

<p>“Oh! but how could you have the courage to keep
house, when you had no family to make boarding impossible?”</p>

<p>“But it needed more courage to go on boarding, I
think,” laughed Molly.</p>

<p>“Oh! wait a bit, till your servant goes off at a moment’s
notice, just as you have company to dinner; or
till your husband begins to criticise the food, or—if
you are too newly married for that—till you see him
look at the table in despair, and sit down and eat as if
it were all chaff,—those are the things that will make
you long to give it all up.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Molly gravely, for that bitter phrase, “if
you are too newly married for that,” shocked her, “I
don’t think, if girls served me so half a dozen times a
year, it would be more than a temporary annoyance,
while to board is a daily and hourly discomfort; as for
my husband, I shall try at least to give him as good
food as we had while boarding.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as good food, but it is the variety; on small
means it is impossible to have it. You smile! it is all
smooth sailing for you yet, but I assure you the first
time you find yourself without a girl you’ll realize what
I mean; but it is beautiful to see your enthusiasm, and
recalls my own early married life.”</p>

<p>She sighed; Molly pretended not to hear her, although
she was full of sympathy for her weary looks;
she laughed lightly and said, “Well, I don’t believe I
should be in despair to find myself without a maid! It
would worry Mr. Bishop for my sake, but not me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well in theory, but when it comes to
having the breakfast to get, the fires to light, and you
find the bread won’t rise, and nothing goes as it ought
to go, you’ll be inclined to sit down and cry.”</p>

<p>“But I think things would go better than that. I am
so fond of cooking that I shall practice a good deal, so
that, if I find myself deserted, we shall not feel the loss
beyond less leisure for me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are fond of cooking—that’s different! I hate
it, but then that’s because I have it to do, I suppose, for,
though I sympathized with you in advance in case you
are left without, I never have a servant; and as I have
four children, and make all their clothes and my own,
you may suppose I have no time to spend over the fire.
We are obliged to live very plainly, and if I can manage
to get the food on the table in an eatable form,
that’s all I try for. I tell you this now because, if, as
I hope, we should become more than formal acquaintances,
you will know what to expect at my house.”</p>

<p>There was a pained look in the weary face, as if the
saying had not been pleasant, and Molly’s heart ached
at the sad picture of toil her words conjured up. And
yet, after she had left, Molly remembered the dress of
cheap material, but trimmed to excess, and thought of
the weary hours it had taken to make, and wondered
why she did it.</p>

<p>Molly, when again alone, hesitated what to do. She
knew of several bits of sewing she had to do for the
house, but she was a little tired; and besides, after a
week or two Marta would not need her so much in the
kitchen—or, at least, she hoped not; meanwhile, the new
“Century” was on the table, and she took it up to read
till it became necessary for her to go and direct Marta.</p>

<p>Molly had had a hint or two from her two visitors
that they considered she would be making rather a slave
of herself, but she had no such intention; she did not
think it harder work to be in the kitchen than at the
sewing-machine. At half past five she went to see if
the table was neatly laid, and made a few changes, calling
Marta’s attention to them; then went into the
kitchen, and found the parsley and onion not nearly fine
enough; these she chopped over, and by that time the
potatoes and Lima beans were done.</p>

<p>“Pour the water off the beans, Marta, then dress
them just as you did the cabbage last night; stir them
well around, and move them to a part of the range
where they will just simmer. When you have done it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
you can put the oysters on the table, six on each plate,
the points to the centre, with a quarter of a lemon in
the middle of each.”</p>

<p>While she was speaking, Molly had put a little milk
on to boil, and cut the tops from the potatoes, and holding
them in a cloth, scooped out the inside with a spoon,
into a bowl which she had made hot, without breaking
the skin; when the potato was all out, she added to it
a table-spoonful of butter and the parsley and onion,
moistening the whole with hot milk, and then with a
fork she beat it rapidly back and forth till very white
and light; then she seasoned with salt and pepper to
taste, and filled the skins, which she had put to keep
hot again, and set them in the oven. The milk being
boiling and the process quick, they had not had time to
cool much.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, heat the gridiron and put your dishes
to get hot; then put the steak on, open all the drafts
that the smoke may go up.”</p>

<p>The fire was clear and not too high, and she watched
while Marta broiled it, directing her to turn the steak
frequently.</p>

<p>“Keep the gridiron tilted from you, so that the grease
runs to the back of the stove, and don’t be frightened at
its flaring; better it should flare than smoke; it is the
smoke, not the flame, that blackens the steak.”</p>

<p>When it had broiled eight minutes it was to be laid
on a hot dish, with a lump of butter on it, and liberally
seasoned with pepper and salt. But as Molly heard
Harry come in, she left the butter and seasoning ready
and went to him, trusting Marta to bring the dinner to
table, telling her, as she left the kitchen, to put the
cheese canapées in the oven, on the upper shelf. They
would be brown by the time they had finished the meat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>MOLLY AND MRS. LENNOX—ECONOMICAL BUYING
MAKES GOOD LIVING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> passed, and Molly found her ten dollars
left a narrow margin, as will be seen from the account
she triumphantly showed to Harry, and the week’s
bills of fare, which she wrote out neatly, appending
every recipe, and which, for the benefit of those who
may wish to do likewise, I will give in its place; but
before that week was over, Molly was resolving other
problems. She had seen Mrs. Lennox again, and Harry
was delighted with Mr. Lennox, who traveled on the
same train with him, and in answer to Molly’s remarks
on the hard life his wife led, he maintained that his pity
was for the husband.</p>

<p>“I can picture to myself that household, Molly, and
the scrambling meals that man gets. Why, he was astounded
when I told him we lived just as well as I want
to live, and what we had to live on. Yes, dear, I fear
I did boast to the poor fellow of the charming little dinners
you got up, and asked if he knew any one who
could beat that? He said:—</p>

<p>“‘Well, I wish Mrs. Bishop would teach my wife how
to put some flavor into what we eat. Our means are
narrow, but I do know that if Letty knew how to cook,
we should all be better, and she herself. We can’t expect
fancy dishes—our family is too large and our
means too small for that—but even Irish stew may
taste of something besides onions and hot water.’</p>

<p>“I should think it could; nothing I enjoy better than
Irish stew. However, I didn’t crow any more over
poor Lennox, but you needn’t give all your pity to
Mrs. Lennox.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Already Molly had decided in her own mind that
Mrs. Lennox was making a great mistake in the way she
had chosen for doing her duty to her family, and that the
weary days spent at the sewing-machine might be partly
spent in the kitchen with advantage to her own health
and her children’s. She longed to help her, but dared
not take the liberty. But the day came when Mrs. Lennox
herself gave the opening. They met in the street
on Saturday, and Molly mentioned that she was on her
way to the butcher’s.</p>

<p>“I see you go every morning down town, but it is
rare for me, for I can’t spare the time, so I have to trust
to what the butcher sends. You see we live so plainly
that we haven’t much choice—it’s just steak and
chops and roast beef. Mr. Lennox can’t bear cold mutton,
so we never get a joint of it.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think the morning walk would do
you good? I believe it will me; and then I have some
satisfaction in seeing my meat before I buy it, although
we buy very little.”</p>

<p>Molly was terribly afraid of seeming didactic, and
spoke in a rather apologetic way.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you haven’t four children, my dear; however,
as I am out, I will go with you. How I wish you
would tell me what to get in place of chops for to-day
and a roast for to-morrow! We all hate them, but we
can’t afford poultry.”</p>

<p>“I hardly like to suggest, for I don’t know your
tastes; but if I wanted to live cheaply,—forgive me,
you have given me reason to suppose that you have to
be economical”—</p>

<p>“Economy isn’t the word,—we can barely make
ends meet, and I work myself to death to avoid spending
an unnecessary dime.”</p>

<p>“I know you do, and for that reason I would like to
tell you a few things I learnt in France, where they
make a franc go as far as we would a dollar, and yet
live well.”</p>

<p>“Tell it me; but for goodness’ sake don’t tell me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
lentils are as good as meat—we abhor lentils—or that
peas and beans are nitrogenous; I’ve read that sort of
thing till I’m sick; if you haven’t the appetite of a
ploughman you can’t eat things because they contain
nitrogen any more than you can live on medicine.”</p>

<p>“I’m a little of your opinion, but I mean really good
living that, if you didn’t know the cost, would seem almost
luxurious. It is simply buying, and using what
you buy, judiciously.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox smiled a little incredulously, but said,
courteously, “I am quite open to conviction.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to pay for your roast of
beef?”</p>

<p>“It will be at least $2, for it is of no use getting less
than eight pounds; and chops for to-day will be about
35 cents.”</p>

<p>“And how long will the roast last?”</p>

<p>“It has to last till Tuesday, though out of an eight-pound
roast there isn’t much but bone and fat the third
day.”</p>

<p>“And you have then something extra to get for
breakfast?”</p>

<p>She laughed a little. “To tell the truth, our breakfast
is slim; I can’t afford meat, and Mr. Lennox usually
has an egg or two; he never cares, fortunately, for
a heavy breakfast, but prefers knick-knacks.”</p>

<p>“This is the sort of housekeeping Harry dreaded,”
thought Molly, but she said aloud, “Then you would
really spend $2.35 this morning for meat to last till
Tuesday?”</p>

<p>“At the very least, but more likely $2.75, for they
could hardly cut me exactly eight pounds.”</p>

<p>“Then I would suggest you get, instead of the roast,
either a leg of mutton at 15 cents a pound, or a piece
of beef at the same price for <i>à la mode</i> beef; and if you
choose the mutton, then you will have a really nice pot-pie
to-night in place of chops. You will find that you
will buy ten pounds of meat for $1.50, and then you can
get some of the knick-knacks Mr. Lennox likes for
breakfast.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he won’t look at cold mutton, or Irish stew
made of it.”</p>

<p>“No; Irish stew needs fresh meat, and cold mutton
is not appetizing; but I propose your having hot mutton
each meal.”</p>

<p>“But that will make so much cooking, and I am
alone to do it!”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Molly, gently, “but I am sure that
sewing-machine is half killing you; can’t you give it up
for an hour or two each day?”</p>

<p>“My dear, by the time I get through my housework
it is near noon; then there’s the children’s dinner to
get and clear, and I don’t get to sewing till after one.
Then the afternoon and evening I have to give to it; if
I could go and buy new material I need not have half
the work, but it is the cutting down, making over, ripping,
altering, and planning that wears one out.”</p>

<p>“Then I will help you,” said Molly. “I have time,
and if you’ll promise to give one hour to the kitchen,
I’ll sew an hour with you and cook an hour. I am so
sure the change of work will brighten you up.”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows I need brightening! I feel a perfect
hag, and I’m only twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>“Then you accept?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” hesitating; “yet I don’t know why I can allow
you to”—</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say one word! I love it.”</p>

<p>They had slackened pace in their earnest talk, but
now they had reached the butcher’s.</p>

<p>“You are to order just what you like,” said Mrs.
Lennox.</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Molly chose a good-sized leg of mutton, weighing
eight pounds, and told the butcher to cut it nearly in
half, leaving the large part for the loin end; and a pound
and half of round steak. She ordered also half a pound
of beef suet; then, turning to Mrs. Lennox, she asked
if Mr. Lennox was fond of kidneys for breakfast?</p>

<p>“I believe he is.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a beef kidney was added, and the amount spent
was:—</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="more grocery prices">
<tr><td align="left">Leg of mutton,</td><td align="right">$1.20</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Suet,</td><td align="right">.06</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Total,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">$1.60</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“Well, I count myself nearly a dollar in pocket so
far,” said Mrs. Lennox, “but I have tried buying economical
meats before, though in the end it was no economy,
for we did not eat it.”</p>

<p>“I will forgive you if you don’t eat this,” said Molly,
laughing; “but I must hurry home; I have a chicken
pie to make for to-morrow’s dinner, but I will see you
later in the day. I am responsible, you know, for the
meat I have bought.”</p>

<p>Molly’s own dinner being soup, veal cutlets, potato
croquettes, Lima beans, and apple pudding, and the
soup ready, all but heating it, she meant to make the
pudding and prepare the croquettes, and leave Marta to
her own resources for the vegetables and breading cutlets,—she,
herself, would be back in time to see the
actual cooking of her own meat. But of her own cooking
I will speak in the next chapter.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, then, Molly went over to Mrs.
Lennox, whom she found busy feather-stitching several
yards of navy blue cashmere ruffling with red crewel.</p>

<p>“This is for Milly’s fall frock; it was first my dress,
then Lily’s, now it comes to Milly, and the red will
make a change.”</p>

<p>“You have far more patience than I,” said Molly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t know what I should do without it.
Must the cooking begin now? I hate to lose daylight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the pot-pie will take long, slow cooking to be
good, but you can come back in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh! suppose we have that steak fried—just for to-day;
well pounded it will be tender enough. I hate to
leave this.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will go down, then, if you will let one of the little
girls show me where you keep things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I can’t let you!” said Mrs. Lennox. “But
that is just it; don’t you see yourself I have no time to
cook?”</p>

<p>Molly longed to say that it seemed as important to
her that the food should be well prepared as that the
flounce should be feather-stitched, but of course, she said
nothing, and the next minute they were down in Mrs.
Lennox’s neat kitchen.</p>

<p>“This pot-pie I propose making is an English dish
my father was very fond of, and it is a little different
from our dish of that name.”</p>

<p>“This is very kind of you, Mrs. Bishop. I only fear
you will see what an up-hill business it is to make a
family live well on very little money.”</p>

<p>“What do you call little?” asked Molly, busily cutting
the steak into finger-lengths.</p>

<p>“$80 a month to keep six people, and out of it $20
for rent; that leaves sixty for everything else.”</p>

<p>Molly thought that was not too little to insure a
plain, solid comfort, but she must gain Mrs. Lennox’s
confidence in her ability and good-will before telling
her so, and she went on quietly preparing for the pot-pie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>BEEF POT-PIE—LEG OF MUTTON—TWO ROASTS—SEVERAL
WHOLESOME ECONOMICAL DISHES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly had cut the steak into finger-lengths,
she floured the pieces lightly, and put an iron saucepan
that held about three quarts on the stove, and, when it
was hot, dropped in the fat of the steak, then the meat,
and left them to fry at the bottom of the saucepan.</p>

<p>“I should think that would burn,” said Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p>“No, because the meat fat is there; but it has to
brown very quickly, or the meat will be hard; that
is why I let the saucepan get so hot. Now I want a
carrot, an onion, and a turnip—all of medium size.”</p>

<p>“I have only small onions.”</p>

<p>“Two of those, then.”</p>

<p>Molly washed and then began to peel them—the
turnip thick, the carrot very thin.</p>

<p>“What can <i>I</i> do?” asked Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p>“You can chop that suet very fine, taking away all
skin and veins.”</p>

<p>Molly cut the vegetables into slices a quarter of an
inch thick, made piles of half a dozen slices of carrot,
then cut across them at even distances; it was more
quickly done than the usual hit or miss way, and they
looked far better; the turnip she did the same, and then
she stirred the meat round, which was sending a savory
odor through the house. The peeled onion she dropped
into water, and then, with hands still in the water, cut it
across at equal distances all the way through, then across
again.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that in water for?”</p>

<p>“It prevents the odor clinging so much to the hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and also mitigates its power to make me weep.” As
she spoke she took all the vegetables to the saucepan,
dropped them in and stirred them quickly round, then
poured two kitchen cups of boiling water on the whole,
and seasoned it with a tea-spoonful of salt and a quarter
one of pepper.</p>

<p>“I want to watch that come to the boil, and then put
it where it will just simmer.”</p>

<p>She had covered the saucepan close, and then turned
to Mrs. Lennox. The suet in her unaccustomed hands
was still far from being chopped fine, and the warmth of
the kitchen had made it clog together. Molly said, “If
suet gets soft while being chopped, shake a little flour
into it, also flour the chopping-knife. When chopping it
in winter for mincemeat, I let it get well frozen.” She
chopped vigorously as she spoke, and it was soon so
fine as to look like tapioca. She then turned to the
saucepan, which had reached the boiling-point, and drew
it aside, carefully changing the position until it just
simmered. She then pointed out to Mrs. Lennox the
little sizzling round the edge of the saucepan, barely
perceptible, and told her that it should cook no faster.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t appear to be cooking at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! and meat stewed so will always be tender.
If you like we can go to the sewing now, as it is too
soon to make the crust.”</p>

<p>She went upstairs and sewed till five o’clock, chatting
the while, Mrs. Lennox expatiating on the privations
of the whole family; and Molly could well
understand how it came about, with a poor, weary
mother sewing strenuously to make the children look
well, and understanding so little of domestic economy
that she did not see that, by a different mode of living,
she would save enough in the month either to buy new
clothes or to lessen her own incessant labor by getting
help. Nor could Molly at this time make any suggestion.</p>

<p>At five o’clock Molly took a cup of the suet, and a
scant two cups of flour, with a level tea-spoonful of salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tossed all together in a bowl, then made a hole in the
centre, and poured in half a cup of cold water, <i>quickly</i> and
<i>lightly</i> made it into a dough with a knife, adding a few
drops of water to bind the crumbs; there was no pressure,
no attempt at kneading, and the dough was soft,
but not sticky; then she turned it on the floured pastry-board,
and rolled it quickly; it formed a fairly good
round shape, an inch thick, and somewhat larger than
the top of the saucepan. She laid it on the top of the
meat and vegetables, after tasting the gravy to see if it
was seasoned enough.</p>

<p>“You see it forms a sort of lid to the stew, which
must now be put forward, as the cold crust has cooled it,
till it boils again, or the crust will be heavy.” She
placed it in the hottest spot as she spoke.</p>

<p>“But do you mean to say that crust will be light without
baking powder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite light; if it is made quickly, rolled only
once—just as you would biscuit dough, only not so soft—brought
quickly to the boiling-point when in the saucepan,
and then <i>kept gently simmering</i> an hour, not allowed
to soak in the gravy without cooking. But if you choose
you can add baking-powder; it makes a much more
crumbly crust. Made as I have made it, it is considered
very wholesome and nourishing, as beef fat and wheaten
flour are two of the best kinds of food; lard and flour
and baking-powder are by no means so wholesome a
combination. When dishing it, cut the top crust pie-fashion,
and lay it round the meat.”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating,’
and if it is fairly good I shall be so glad to have some
dish that is a change from our routine, and it is, after all,
easy enough,” said Mrs. Lennox, washing potatoes for
the oven.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite! It only needs strict attention to the <i>little</i>
points, the slow simmering and the seasoning; the
browning at first is not necessary, although it is better
looking and better flavored by taking that little
trouble.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, my dear, it is the <i>little</i> trouble, that seems nothing
to you, that makes so much difference to a busy
woman like me.”</p>

<p>“If you like this dish, I have several others that I
think you may find both very cheap and very nice, and
I shall be very glad at any time to come over and give
you a helping hand in the kitchen. And, by and bye,
this suet crust is the foundation for several good puddings,—rolled
out and spread with jam, and boiled one
hour and a half as a roly-poly, it is excellent; with a
cup of currants added, before wetting the flour and suet,
it makes the ‘spotted Dick’ dear to English children;
or, in place of currants, the juice of a lemon and the
grated rind of two, with half a cup of sugar, makes a
nice plain lemon pudding, but long, steady boiling is absolutely
necessary to lightness. Excuse my telling you
all this, but you know I am so fond of cooking, I can’t
help it.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged. I like to hear all about it, even
if I can’t make the things.”</p>

<p>“Now about that leg of mutton: I propose you roast
the loin end to-morrow, and there will be a little left
cold, which you will not use on Monday, but cook
the other half—have it boiled, with caper sauce, or
roasted.”</p>

<p>“I will boil it, for that is a dish we all like; only what
to do with cold <i>boiled</i> mutton I don’t know; that is why,
though we like it, we never have it.”</p>

<p>“Tuesday, you will have the remains of the Sunday
roast and the remains of Monday’s boiled mutton, and I
will run in and show you how to make a nice dish of
them; but be sure to boil the half leg in only just enough
water, and <i>very slowly</i>, and keep the broth; if you boil
a turnip and onion with it, it will be all the better for
broth and meat.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; that sounds like a great improvement
on hot meat Sunday and cold Monday and Tuesday.
What about that kidney? I haven’t an idea how to
cook it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Soak it in salt and water an hour; cut it in pieces
half an inch thick, leaving out the core; flour them; put
them in a saucepan with half a table-spoonful of butter
and a thin slice of onion, unless it is disliked; let them
fry five minutes, then add half a tea-cup of boiling water,
and stand the saucepan where it will just simmer ten
minutes—if you leave it longer the kidney will be hard.
I like to have it served on toast, but that is optional;
only be sure it is served as soon as cooked, and with
quite hot plates.”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much. Mr. Lennox will enjoy
his breakfast, I’ve no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, too,” said Molly.</p>

<p>“I dare say I shall, thanks to you.”</p>

<p>Molly hurried home, for she had her own dinner to
attend to; and to-night she was going to look over her
accounts and convince Harry that “Ten Dollars” is
“Enough” to pay all the weekly expenses they would
be likely to incur.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>VEAL CUTLETS, BREADED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly reached home it was nearly six. Marta
had followed directions fairly well, but Molly had taken
the precaution to do everything she could before leaving
home. She had herself cut half the veal cutlets into
neat pieces, the size of a large oyster, leaving the rest
for her pie, pounded each, squeezed on it a few drops
of lemon juice, and piled one upon the other, and told
Marta to leave them so an hour or two, then bread them
exactly as she had done the lamb chops. She had also
cut some <i>thin</i> slices of breakfast bacon, taken off the
rind and dark inner skin very thinly; and now, having
let the frying-pan get quite hot, she put the bacon in it.
As soon as it looked clear she turned it; it curled up,
and when it had been in the pan about three minutes
she took it out and laid in the cutlets; the half a dozen
pieces left room to turn them about comfortably.</p>

<p>“You see, Marta, I don’t drop these into deep fat,
because veal is a meat that requires long cooking, and is
one of the few things I think better fried, or rather
‘<i>sauté</i>,’ in this way, with only enough fat to cook them,
but it is much more trouble to do than the frying in
boiling fat.”</p>

<p>The cutlets took nearly ten minutes to fry a nice
brown on one side, because, although the pan was kept
at a good heat, she had to guard against burning.
Then each piece was turned, and, when quite brown (it
took nearly ten minutes more to get so), taken up and
put on the dish, and the bacon round it. Molly took
the pan to the table, poured off the fat, which was dark,
and put in the pan a dessert-spoonful of butter and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
scant one of flour, set them on the stove and let them
melt and brown a little; then she drew the pan aside,
and poured a small cup of the hot soup they were going
to have for dinner into it, and stirred till smooth, mashing
all the brown clinging gravy with the back of her
spoon. She explained to Marta that, if the soup had
not been at hand, water and pepper and salt would have
been used; or, if there was oyster liquor in the house,
she should have used that and water in equal parts.</p>

<p>“Now take in the soup, Marta,—and while that is on
the table, let this gravy boil a few seconds, then pour it
through the strainer into the dish with the cutlets; don’t
let it boil longer, or it will get too thick.”</p>

<p>After dinner, Harry told Molly that one of the gentlemen
on the cars, a friend of the Winfields’, had spoken
to him about joining a dramatic reading-club, of which
he was president, and said his wife was coming to invite
Molly. “But I don’t think we can afford it, dear.”</p>

<p>“Would you like it?” asked Molly quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! Yes, I think it might brighten
the winter a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will see after my accounts are audited.
First, I want to ask you how you consider you have
fared this week?”</p>

<p>“Admirably,—so well that I’m afraid of the accounts.”</p>

<p>“You need not be. Now I want you to listen while
I read over the bills of fare for the week.”</p>

<p>Harry nodded in amused good humor, and smoked on
comfortably.</p>

<p>“On <span class="smcap">Monday</span> we had chicken salad, etc., for lunch.
<i>Dinner</i>—Roast shoulder of lamb, potatoes, cabbage,
macaroni, tomato salad, and peaches and cream.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tuesday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Breaded chops, baked potatoes,
corn muffins.”</p>

<p>Harry nodded assent to each item as Molly turned
her bright eyes on him to make sure he was giving attention.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tuesday.</span> <i>Dinner</i>—Oysters, steak, ragout of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lamb, stuffed potatoes, Lima beans, cheese canapées, and
lemon pie.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Hashed lamb, poached
eggs, and soufflé bread. <i>Dinner</i>—Tomato cream soup,
roast breast of lamb, chicken croquettes, stewed onions
and potatoes, peach pudding.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Thursday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Lamb chops broiled, eggs,
tomato salad, stewed potatoes, muffins. <i>Dinner</i>—Fried
smelts, beef <i>à la mode</i>, cones of carrots and turnips,
mashed potatoes, lettuce salad, cheese fritters, amber
pudding.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Friday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Brown hash, poached eggs,
corn bread, baked potatoes. <i>Dinner</i>—Bisque of clams,
beef <i>au gratin</i>, chicken rissoles, cauliflower, potatoes,
tomato salad, custard pie.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Saturday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Scalloped clams, cauliflower,
omelet, pop-overs, stewed potatoes. <i>Dinner</i>—Clear
soup, veal cutlets, mashed potatoes, cabbage, macaroni,
apple pudding.</p>

<p>“And to-morrow’s breakfast and dinner, though not
eaten, is paid for, so I add that.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sunday.</span> <i>Breakfast</i>—Broiled bacon, poached eggs,
muffins. <i>Dinner</i>—Clear soup, chicken pie, mashed
potatoes, creamed onions, tomato salad, peach compote,
and custard.”</p>

<p>Molly concluded her list with rather a triumphant air,
as one who knows she has achieved what she set out
to do.</p>

<p>“Yes, Molly, we have had all those good breakfasts
and dinners, and I’m afraid to think of the work you
have had to cook all that. Let me look at your poor
little hands.”</p>

<p>She held them towards him. They were white and
soft as ever.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he said, pressing them between his
own, “I feel such a selfish brute to let you do it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I like it. Why, didn’t I always go to
Mrs. Welles’ house after each cooking-lesson, and repeat
the whole lesson, when I hadn’t the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of seeing you share the good things I made, because we
were boarding? And didn’t she and I repeat every
failure until we got it right? Those were the days when
I had backaches and headaches, because I was so anxious
to succeed and failed so often; but <i>now</i> it is all at my
fingers’ ends, and no more trouble than the simplest
cooking—far less, indeed; it takes a little more time
and makes more washing-up for Marta; and if we had a
large family and I had other duties, I could not give so
much time; nor would it be right to overwork one girl
to cater to our tastes; but in a tiny house like this, with
two or even four people, there’s no question of overwork
for either mistress or maid.”</p>

<p>“But even your time, dear, oughtn’t to be sacrificed
to give me good dinners.”</p>

<p>“No, nor will it be; but what is my time good for,
except to make your income go as far as it will? I get
all the time to read I want; I am not fond of plain sewing;
and as clothes ready made can now be bought so
good and cheap, I don’t mean to do more than keep the
buttons sewed on,”—here she smiled as she thought of
the favorite grievance,—“the stockings well darned, and
everything mended; so; you’ll never have the satisfaction
of seeing me stitch long white seams, nor wear a shirt
made by me.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!” ejaculated Harry.</p>

<p>“No, nowadays <i>that</i> I consider real waste of time.
And then I’ve no gift for fancy work, pretty as the
modern version of it is, so I’d like to know what I
should do with the whole day if I didn’t do something in
the kitchen? I expect, when Marta is trained, never to
spend more than an hour and a half each day there, and
an hour besides for the other little household duties; that
leaves a margin for visiting, reading, and the sewing I
may have.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Molly dear; that programme sounds very
easy, but whether it works in practice I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Everything depends on Marta,—if she shows intelligence
and cares to learn, things will go as I have
planned after the first month; but supposing she actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
never proves capable of doing the cooking alone, I
shall simply make up my mind to spend the hour between
five and six every day in the kitchen. I shan’t
like to do it, because it ought not to be necessary, but
one has to accept some shortcoming with any servant,
and I would sooner this than some others; but to make
it worth while to keep her under those circumstances,
she must be very good in other things. There! I’m
talking instead of attending to business,” said Molly;
“here is an account of our expenditure.”</p>

<p class="unindent">which brought the amount to $11.22; one fourth of
which, $2.80, added to $7.19, made the week’s expenditure
$9.99.</p>

<p>“Now, although that amount has been spent this
week, you must remember that of several of the articles
bought, a little is left, and I have not to begin this week
without a scrap in the house as I had the last,” explained
Molly. “We need ice only a week or two longer, but
when that need ceases we shall require more fuel; but I
think a dollar a week <i>all the year round</i> will average ice
and fuel, so I shall allow that. We shall use $2 a week
for a few weeks, but barely 50 cents the rest of the
year.”</p>

<p>Molly laid the accounts before her husband as she finished,
and he gravely looked them over.</p>

<p>“And if, this month, I come out even five cents ahead,
we may count ourselves safe, for buying in the
very small quantities I am now doing is an extravagant
way. But I wanted to make sure my ‘paper housekeeping’
would work in practice.”</p>

<p>There was rather an anxious look in Harry’s eyes as
he read over the accounts. He was afraid Molly had
sadly miscalculated, and he hated to prove her at fault,
although he loved to poke fun at her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked his wife, starting up
and looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Only, dear, if you remember, we had chicken in one
form or other several times this week, but there is only
one chicken counted, and that is to-day. Also lamb
chops we have had several times.” He glanced up at
her deprecatingly, for he felt such criticism ungracious,
yet necessary; but Molly was quite serene.</p>

<p>“The box of chicken in Monday’s bill was all I’ve
used; the chops also were from Monday. There’s one
thing, though, I will call your attention to, and that is,
that the most expensive meal we have had was the steak,
yet people who use steak every day are supposed to live
<i>plainly</i> and <i>economically</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then we come out wonderfully, I acknowledge.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“This week, of course, Marta has simply seen how I
want things done; next week I want her to actually do
the cooking from recipes. Do you think you can stand
last week’s dinners all over again?”</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear; why not?”</p>

<p>“That’s well, because if I teach her new things before
she has learnt these thoroughly, she will get confused.
I want to feel that there are a few things I can
absolutely trust her to do. Then I can go on to fresh
fields, so you may have things that are difficult to cook
rather oftener than I like, till Marta is capable.”</p>

<p>“I shall not object to aid in Marta’s education so far,”
said Harry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>DETAILS OF MOLLY’S MANAGEMENT—RECIPES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> had not entered so fully into matters with
Harry as she would have done had he been a woman;
but as this story is to tell, not only what Molly did, but
how she did it, I must be a little more explicit.</p>

<p>She found herself on Wednesday with a breast of
lamb, eight chops, half a box of boned chicken, and a
small piece of steak. The chops were good for two
breakfasts; the chicken, prepared as for croquettes,
would make either eight of those, or three croquettes,
three rissoles, and some fritters. Now, as eight croquettes
for two people would be waste, since they were
only an <i>entrée</i>, the main dinner being something else,
she had no idea of that, but rissoles, fritters and croquettes
being all prepared alike, and keeping better in
that way, she made the mixture, and used enough for
the three croquettes, leaving the rest in the ice-box for
use another day. Part of the chops she would not want
to use till the end of the week, and keeping them quite
sweet she made all the fat that had come from the lamb
(dripping and trimmings, etc.) boiling hot, then laid the
chops in it—<i>seethed</i> them, as it were—for one minute,
then put them away with the coat of fat on them,
to be scraped off when they were to be cooked.</p>

<p>For the clam soup a pint and a half was all that was
needed, and the liquor, with half the clams, was all that
she used; the rest she scalloped for breakfast.</p>

<p>It was in making no more of each dish than they could
eat (but allowing <i>plenty</i> for kitchen as well as dining-room)
that Molly was able to have what seemed a surprising
table,—that and one other thing, allowing <i>nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
whatever</i> to be wasted. The piece of steak left from
Tuesday’s dinner was fag end; it was put away, and when
the hash was made for Friday morning from the remains
of <i>à la mode</i> beef, the steak was just the thing to add
to it.</p>

<p>For lunch there had always been enough in the house
from dinner the night before. As it was her plan to put
Marta more on her own responsibility the following week,
she had prepared for that purpose the recipes of the
principal things; and as Marta’s mistakes and difficulties
might occur to others, the working of them out in her
hands will be more instructive than recounting Molly’s
certain success.</p>

<p>The recipes were as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hashed Lamb.</span>—The remains of ragout of lamb,
freed from bone, chopped with the vegetables, the gravy,
and a tea-spoonful of butter and one of Worcestershire
sauce added; the whole made boiling hot, and served on
fried bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soufflé Bread.</span>—Two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of
flour, in which half a tea-spoonful of baking-powder is
sifted; beat yolks and a table-spoonful of butter, melted,
together, then add flour and <i>just</i> milk enough to make a
<i>very thick</i> batter; add a pinch of salt and a tea-spoonful
of sugar; whip whites of eggs to a firm froth, and stir
gently in. Have ready a small iron spider (or earthen
pan is still better), made hot, with a dessert-spoonful of
butter also hot, but not so hot as for frying; pour the
mixture, which should be like sponge-cake batter, into
the pan, cover with a lid or tin plate, and set it back of
the stove if the fire is good—if slow, it may be quite
forward. When well risen, almost like omelet soufflé,
set it in the oven five minutes to brown the top; if the
oven is cool, you may very carefully turn it, so as not to
deaden it; serve when done, under side uppermost. It
should be a fine golden brown.</p>

<p>Soufflé bread may be <i>baked</i> in a thick tin, with
rather more butter than enough to grease it, but the
oven must be very hot indeed, and it should be covered
till thoroughly puffed up, then allowed to brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomato Cream Soup.</span>—Put six ripe tomatoes on
to stew; when done, boil one pint of milk in a double
boiler, mix two tea-spoonfuls (large) of flour with very
little milk till smooth, then stir it into the boiling milk;
cook ten minutes. To the tomato put a salt-spoonful,
<i>scant</i>, of soda, stir well, then rub through a strainer fine
enough to keep back seeds; add a dessert-spoonful of
butter to the milk, stirring well, then the tomato, and
serve immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breast of Lamb Roasted.</span>—Take out the bones
with a small, sharp knife; put them on to boil with a
piece of carrot and a slice of onion, a pint of water and
a bay leaf; boil for two hours till reduced to less than
half. Roll the breast (it may be seasoned with pepper,
salt and chopped parsley before rolling) and skewer it,
then brush it over with egg and roll in cracker crumbs;
bake in a good oven an hour and a half, basting often.
It should be very well browned, but not burnt. When
done take it up, put a dessert-spoonful of butter in the
pan, which set on the stove, then add a scant one of
flour; let them brown together, stirring the while;
strain to it the gravy from the bones, stirring quickly to
prevent lumps, season to taste, add a tea-spoonful of
lemon juice or vinegar, and pour round the meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Chicken_Croquettes"></a>Chicken Croquettes.</span>—Half a box of boned
chicken, or half a chicken; chop it fine, flavor with a
few mushrooms, or a little oyster liquor, or oysters
chopped, or a very little ham, or simply a piece of onion
as large as a hazel-nut, scalded and chopped <i>very</i>
fine, and a tea-spoonful of <i>finely</i> chopped parsley. In
flavoring this (and other dishes) take advantage of what
may be in the house suitable. Put a table-spoonful of
butter in a small saucepan with a table-spoonful of flour,
stir till they bubble, then put into a half-pint measure a
gill of strong stock made from bones (Molly had bruised
up the bones from the shoulder of lamb and boiled
them down) and, if you have it, a gill of cream or
milk (unless you have oyster or mushroom liquor, when
<i>half</i> a gill of cream), and fill up with either of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
(the liquid, of whatever kind, must be just half a pint
to this quantity); pour this on the butter and flour, and
stir till it forms a <i>thick</i>, smooth sauce; boil five minutes,
season highly, and then mix the chicken with it; stir together,
and pour it out on a plate, and put it to get quite
cold and firm. If no stock is used, an egg must be
stirred into the sauce, moving it a few seconds from the
fire before adding it, or it will curdle. When it is cold
and stiff, put plenty of cracker meal on a board, beat an
egg with a table-spoonful of water, cut the chicken mixture
into strips, roll it between the hands into shapes like
wine corks, <i>no larger</i>, put each one into the egg, then
into the cracker meal, taking care the egg has covered
every part and the meal coats it thoroughly. As each is
done, lay it on a plate of cracker meal. They may be
prepared an hour or two before they are needed. To fry
them, the fat must be so hot that bread dropped into it
will color well in thirty seconds; arrange a few at a time
in a frying basket, set it in the hot fat; two minutes
will make them golden brown; if left longer, or made
too large, they will burst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rissoles.</span>—Take a little fine paste,—any trimmings
will do,—roll it as <i>thin as paper</i>, cut it into squares three
inches by four, lay on each a strip as thick as your finger
of the chicken mixture, and roll up, wetting the edges of
the paste and pressing together, so that there will be no
oozing out; egg and crumb the same as croquettes, and
fry <i>four</i> minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicken Fritters.</span>—Make some good batter thus:
a cup of flour sifted; melt a table-spoonful of butter
in a scant cup of <i>warm</i> water, which pour by degrees to
the flour, making a batter thick enough to mask the back
of a spoon dipped in it; salt to taste; add, the last thing,
the white of an egg well beaten. Make the chicken
mixture into balls the size of small walnuts, flatten a
little, dip into the batter, and drop from the spoon into
<i>very hot</i> fat, the same as croquettes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peach Pudding.</span>—A cup of flour, one tea-spoonful
of baking-powder sifted in it; make into a very thick batter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with three parts of a cup of milk, beat two eggs very
light with a quarter cup of sugar, add a pinch of salt,
mix, and then stir in as many cut-up peaches as you can;
butter a bowl thoroughly, nearly fill with the mixture, tie
a cloth over it, and plunge into <i>fast</i> boiling water; boil
one hour, taking care that ebullition <i>never ceases</i> while
the pudding is in the saucepan, or it will be soggy.
Serve with cream, or soft custard, or hard sauce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peach Fritters</span> are made by the same recipe, but
dropped by the spoonful in boiling lard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fried Smelts.</span>—Cleanse and dry them, then dip
them in milk, then in flour; shake off superfluous flour,
and then egg and crumb them the same as chops, laying
each fish when done on a bed of cracker meal. Make
the lard as hot as for croquettes, and drop them in five
or six at a time. If the lard is hot enough they will
brown in two minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef à la Mode.</span>—Three pounds of the vein or
any coarse part of beef that is solid meat, and half a
pound of fat pork. Pierce the meat in several places
with a knife, and into each hole thus made put a strip of
pork; lay the beef in an earthen pan, with a bay leaf, a
sprig of thyme, four sprigs of parsley, two onions, medium
size, with a clove stuck in each, half a blade of
mace, half a carrot and turnip, a wine-glass of cooking-sherry,
and a gallon of water, with half a salt-spoonful of
pepper. The pan should not be much larger than the
meat. Cover closely, using a common flour and water
paste round the edges to prevent the steam escaping,
and set in a good oven three hours. The wine may be
omitted, and a wine-glass more water added, with a
table-spoonful of Worcestershire sauce and half one of
vinegar. When done, take up the meat carefully, strain
the gravy, skim and season, and pour it over the meat.
Don’t add the salt till the gravy is done, as pork varies
so much that you may get it too salt with very little
added; you must go by taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cones of Carrots and Turnips.</span>—Boil them separately
in quarters, using white turnips; chop each fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in a chopping-bowl, put a dessert-spoonful of butter with
them, season with <i>white</i> pepper and salt, then press
them into a cone shape—a wine-glass will answer—and
stand them in alternate cones of the yellow carrot and
white turnips round the beef <i>à la mode</i> or corned beef.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheese Fritters.</span>—Grate two ounces of cheese
with two dessert-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, a half tea-spoonful
of dry mustard, a dessert-spoonful of butter, a
speck of cayenne, and the yolk of an egg; pound with
a potato-masher till smooth and well mixed, then proceed
as for chicken fritters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amber Pudding.</span>—Two eggs, their weight in
sugar, butter, flour, and the juice and grated peel of one
lemon. Beat the yolks, with the sugar, lemon juice,
and butter softened, till very light; sift in the flour and
grated peel, butter a small bowl or mould, pour the mixture
in and boil two hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bisque of Clams.</span>—For one pint and a half of
soup take a dozen large clams; stew them fifteen minutes
in their own liquor, to which water is added to
make three gills. Boil three gills of milk; stir one dessert-spoonful
of butter and one of flour in a small saucepan
till they bubble; then pour the boiling milk quickly
on them, stirring all the while; stand it aside. Squeeze
each clam with a lemon-squeezer, and you will find little
but an empty skin remains; strain the clams and liquor
to the thick white sauce already made, pressing as much
juice out as possible; then stir well, bring all to a boil,
and remove from the fire while you beat the yolk of an
egg with two table-spoonfuls of the soup; stir it to the
rest and season to taste. Take care the soup is boiling
hot, yet does not boil after the egg is added, or it will
curdle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scalloped Clams.</span>—Take a <i>small</i> cup of the bisque
of clams, before the egg is added, and save it for the
scallop. Scald ten or a dozen clams, cut out the hard
part, chop the rest fine. Butter tin scallop shells or little
saucers thickly, strew them with bread crumbs, put a
layer of clams with pepper, a layer of crumbs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
enough of the soup to moisten them; then more clams,
more pepper, and crumbs over the top, and then a <i>thin</i>
covering of the soup, and bake a rich brown. Serve a
cut lemon with them. Be careful not to get too much
soup on them,—they should be moist, not wet, and be
served very hot. Add a little salt if the clams are not
salt enough, but it is seldom necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cauliflower Omelet.</span>—Two eggs, a half cup of
cold cauliflower with the sauce; mash the cauliflower
and sauce, beat the yolks of eggs with it, then beat the
whites till they will not slip from the dish, and stir them
gently in; add pepper and salt, and fry as any other
omelet.</p>

<p>As Molly had given minute directions to Marta for
frying omelet already, she did not repeat them in her
recipes. When Molly had made the brown hash for
breakfast, she had laid aside some of the nicest slices of
the cold <i>à la mode</i> beef and the gravy for</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef au Gratin.</span>—Put a layer of bread crumbs in
a small dish, then a layer of fat pork cut thin as a wafer,
then a layer of beef, on which strew a very little chopped
onion and parsley, pepper and salt; then another layer
of the shaved pork, more beef, and cover the top with
bread crumbs; over all pour gravy enough to moisten it
well, and bake slowly one hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Custard Pie.</span>—Line the dish with light paste
(Molly used what was left after making the lemon pie,—puff
paste will keep a week in the ice-box), beat one
egg, mix with a small cup of milk and one table-spoonful
of sugar, pour it into the pie, grate nutmeg over, and
bake in an oven that is very hot on the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clear Soup.</span>—Three pounds of soup-meat, or a
soup-bone weighing that; gash the meat well and put to
it three quarts of cold water and three tea-spoonfuls of
salt, half one of pepper, one small carrot, one turnip,
one large onion—each must weigh three ounces <i>after
peeling;</i> stick one clove in the onion, cut the vegetables,
and when the meat has slowly boiled two hours,
add the vegetables and cook three hours more. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<i>slow boiling</i> is meant just an occasional bubble in the
centre of the pot. Skim just as the meat comes to the
boil, then throw in half a cup of cold water; take off the
scum that will now rise rapidly, adding a little cold
water again when it begins to boil. Skim again after
the vegetables are in, and when done, strain. When
cold, take off the fat; don’t shake the soup, but pour
through a clean cloth, all but the sediment, which keep
to make gravy. It must never boil fast, or it will be
cloudy and taste poor. There will be two quarts and a
pint of fine, clear soup, if the boiling has been so slow
as to waste very little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicken Pie.</span>—Put the neck, gizzard, and feet,
scalded, of a chicken in nearly a pint of water with a
small spoonful of salt and a slice of onion and a piece of
carrot as big as your thumb. Let them stew <i>slowly</i> till
there is not more than a gill of liquid, which strain and
put aside; when cold it will be hard jelly. Lay in the
bottom of a deep oval dish that holds rather more than
three quarts, about half a pound of veal cutlet (or beefsteak
if you prefer) finely chopped across, yet not made
into sausage-meat; sprinkle on it a scant salt-spoonful of
salt and a little pepper, shave nice sweet salt pork and
put a thin layer of that; then put in the chicken, neatly
divided into small joints, sprinkling each with a little
salt and pepper, and always pile toward the centre;
when full add forcemeat balls made thus: Chop <i>very
finely</i> a heaped tea-spoonful of parsley, rub a scant salt-spoonful
of thyme leaves to fine powder (this is easily
done if they are put to stand in a hot place a few minutes
before rubbing, taking care they do not burn), add
to them a tea-cup of fine bread crumbs and just one
grate of nutmeg, the nutmeg drawn sharply <i>once</i> up and
down the grater; chop into this a good tea-spoonful of
butter, and wet all with the yolk of an egg; now add a
little salt and pepper, tasting to see when there is
enough; make into little round balls and drop into the
pie wherever there is a chink, and pour over all half a
cup of water. Now roll out some rough puff paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
(made as for lemon pie), cut strips half an inch thick
and two broad, wet the edges of the dish and lay this
round lightly. If the chicken is packed in the shape of
a dome it will slope from the sides, and the paste can be
pressed round the <i>inside</i> edge to make it adhere to the
dish; wet it slightly, then roll the paste for a cover
half an inch thick; lay it on, press, with your forefinger
laid flat to form a groove between the chicken and the
dish, so that the inner edge of the under paste adheres
to the upper one; don’t press the <i>outer</i> edge at all; trim
round with a sharp knife, make a good-sized hole in the
centre and ornament with twisted paste, or as you
choose; brush all over with white of egg (not the edges,
or they will not rise) and bake an hour and a quarter in
a good steady oven. Before it is cold, pour the gravy
made from giblets through the hole in the top, using a
funnel for the purpose. This pie is excellent cold, but
if made the day before using, when made hot it will
take quite half an hour to heat through. Lay a paper
over to protect the crust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>WHAT TO DO WITH A SOUP-BONE.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I don’t</span> think there is any more painful fact connected
with a small income than one’s inability to do
anything for the distress one hears of,” said Harry as
he chipped an egg at breakfast on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>“I feel that too, very keenly; but are you thinking of
any special instance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a poor fellow was killed a few weeks ago on
the track here, and he left a delicate wife and three little
children. They were taking up a collection in the cars
for her yesterday. I contributed my mite, of course; but
what are a few dollars in a case like that? They say he
had been out of work for weeks before he got the employment
that led to his death, and that if some more
permanent help does not reach them, they will be near
starvation this winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, surely not, certainly not, if people only know
of the distress; each one will do a little, and so very little
will keep hunger from them,” said Molly confidently.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so, but unfortunately times are very
hard, and these people are strangers, while all Greenfield
charity is needed for the well-known poor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe in each one doing the duty that lies
before him without waiting to see if others do theirs.
We are strangers here, too; so perhaps we have the best
right to help those like ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Molly,” expostulated Harry, “we can
but just meet our own expenses.”</p>

<p>“I know, but if there is any real need we <i>must</i> do our
part; not as I should like to do it, for to a needy family
I would <i>like</i> to give beefsteak and comforts as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
necessities, but that we can’t do. What we can we will.
Can we spare a dollar a month, do you think, from our
twenty dollars margin?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“I do, if necessary. I will see the woman and judge
if the need is very pressing, and then, perhaps, some of
our neighbors will do something.”</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, Molly, my dear, but what you may
be thinking of I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“If the necessity is great I can do something; if it is
not, the woman may despise what I <i>can</i> do.”</p>

<p>No more was said, but next morning, on her way back
from the depot, after seeing Harry off, she went to a
row of tiny tenements, built on the street through which
the railroad passed, evidently the homes of the very
poor, and in one of which she was told Mrs. Gibbs was
to be found.</p>

<p>In the very poorest of the very poor little group, she
found the widow and her fatherless children, the oldest
only five, the youngest not six weeks old. The mother
looked so frail and white that Molly’s heart ached to
think that what <i>she</i> could do was hardly the sort of help
this poor soul needed. Surely beef tea, and milk and
eggs, and every nourishing thing was required to build
up that fragile frame. And all she would be sure of
giving was bread and occasionally, perhaps, a savory
meal. How she wished she knew more people whom
she might influence for the right kind of help!</p>

<p>She talked to Mrs. Gibbs, and learned that her poor
husband had been in work only a fortnight, after being
months idle from sickness, when the accident happened,
and that the baby was only three days old when its
father died.</p>

<p>“At first every one was good; they came and helped
me and did a great deal; but there are so many needing
help. I could not expect it all to be given to me, and I
did think I might get a little sewing when I was out of
bed, but I have no machine, and so I can only earn a
few cents a week. What I should have done I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
know, if a kind gentleman hadn’t made a collection in
his car for me, and brought me on Saturday $12, which
is owing for two months’ rent.”</p>

<p>“And you will have it <i>all</i> to pay away?” cried Molly.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, I must, but oh, I’m so thankful to have
it. The dread of losing the roof over us is worse than
hunger or anything.”</p>

<p>“But surely you have not needed food?”</p>

<p>The tears came to the woman’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m never hungry, but the children are, and yet I
think if I could get good food for a week or two, I
should get strong and could do work.”</p>

<p>“That food she must have,” thought Molly. “At all
events, for a few days she shall have half a pound of
steak or a chop. I believe her. That delicate look is
semi-starvation.”</p>

<p>Molly bought at the butcher’s that morning one pound
of the tender side of the round steak. It cost sixteen
cents, and she intended Mrs. Gibbs to have one third for
three days.</p>

<p>“Then when she has one nourishing solid meal a day
she can make up on other things, and the dollar we have
squeezed out for her must be made to go as far as possible.”</p>

<p>When Molly had made her clear soup on Saturday
she had looked regretfully at the couple of pounds of
meat and vegetables that were strained from it, wishing
she knew to whom to give it, as her own family was
not large enough to need it, and hoping some one might
ask for food at the door. She had kept it, also about a
cup of the soup that was thick at the bottom (the richest
part, although for appearance’ sake it must not be
used with <i>clear</i> soup).</p>

<p>She had a use for it now: it would make a savory
hash, not nourishing enough for an invalid like Mrs.
Gibbs to depend on, but good for her children and herself,
in addition to the steak.</p>

<p>Marta was busy washing; so, soon after eleven, Molly
chopped the meat and vegetables quite fine, added about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a third the quantity of cold mashed potato to it, a tea-spoonful
of Worcestershire sauce, and a table-spoonful of
flour. This she moistened with a half cup of the soup
and seasoned it with pepper and salt. Then she greased
a deep yellow pie-plate, put the hash in it and set it in
the oven.</p>

<p>Having some kind of hot bread every morning, Molly
used but very little bread. She had made a loaf on
Saturday which was more than half left. She must
give that, and make a few quick rolls for their own dinner.</p>

<p>While the hash was getting brown she put a pint of
flour to dry and warm, and the third of a cake of compressed
yeast to dissolve in a cup of warm milk, into
which, when well mixed, she stirred a table-spoonful of
butter till it got soft, and then the beaten yolk of an
egg, two tea-spoonfuls of sugar and one half of salt.</p>

<p>She made a hole in the flour, poured in the milk, etc.,
and stirred them together, adding a little more warm
milk till it was a thick paste, too stiff for batter, yet not
stiff enough for dough,—<i>just as stiff as it would be
stirred with a spoon</i>. She beat it for five minutes, and
then set it, covered with a cloth, in a warm place.</p>

<p>The hash was now quite brown; and, as Molly had no
one to send to-day, she put on her bonnet and took it
and the bread and piece of steak to Mrs. Gibbs, begging
her to cook and eat the latter for herself.</p>

<p>“I will for baby’s sake. Thank you! Oh, thank
you!”</p>

<p>At two o’clock the rolls Molly had set had risen to
the top of the bowl, which had been half full. She beat
them down with a spoon thoroughly, covered them again
and put them to rise, and in an hour they were again
light. The dough was beaten down, a dozen gem-pans
were greased, and a scant table-spoonful of the paste put
into each; the paste was so thick and ropy that it was
difficult to take up with a spoon, and a floured knife
helped the performance. There was a small cupful
left, and to this Molly put a tea-spoonful more sugar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
put it into a small round tin pan, that had once evidently
been a dipper; this was for breakfast. They
were all now put to rise, and in half an hour they looked
like little balloons rising out of the pans. They were
brushed lightly over with warm milk and put in the
oven; the rolls took fifteen minutes, the breakfast-cake
twenty-five, to bake.</p>

<p>The chicken pie Molly had made for Sunday had only
been half eaten, as there had been three quarters of a
pound of veal in it as well as the chicken,—the drumsticks
of which, by the way, she had reserved for Monday
morning’s breakfast, prepared in the following way:</p>

<p>The sinews were taken out, when the feet were cut
off, in this way: the yellow skin only was cut, the sinews
were drawn out, the bones removed and their places
filled with a forcemeat made of veal chopped very fine,
with an equal proportion of salt pork. Molly had bought
enough veal on Saturday for dinner and the pie, and she
took a very small piece of that cooked in the latter, for
her forcemeat, of which there was needed only two scant
table-spoonfuls altogether, and just enough of the jelly
to moisten it. She seasoned the forcemeat rather highly,
then filled the place of the removed bones with it, taking
care not to pack it too tight, sewed up the opening (having
left a good piece of the skin of the thigh on the
legs when removing them), wrapped each in a very thin
slice of pork, tied them round, floured them, and baked
them in a sharp oven twenty-five minutes, and they were
brown and crisp when taken up.</p>

<p>To make the pie presentable for dinner at small expense
she had ordered a dozen large oysters; the oyster
liquor was strained, a table-spoonful of butter and half
one of flour put in a saucepan, stirred till they bubbled,
then the cold pie, all but the pastry, added to it, with
part of the oyster liquor and the oysters. The pastry
was cut into neat pieces, and put into the oven to get hot,
while Molly chopped a table-spoonful of parsley very fine.</p>

<p>When the fricassee came to the boiling-point, it was
carefully stirred round and the parsley sprinkled in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
then the oysters were left five minutes to plump. While
doing this she directed Marta to prepare a <i>fondue</i>, telling
her to put a table-spoonful of butter and one of flour
in a small saucepan, stir them till they bubbled, and then
to add a gill of milk to them.</p>

<p>“That is really thick white sauce, you see, Marta; you
will soon know of how many things a good white sauce
is the foundation. Stir to prevent burning. Now add
to it the two ounces of cheese I told you to grate, and a
level salt-spoonful of salt, and as much pepper as will go
on the end of the salt-spoon. Now you can take it off
the fire, and turn it into a bowl; beat the yolks of two
eggs light, and stir them to it. While you dish and
dress the cabbage, and take up the potatoes and fricassee,
I will beat the whites of three eggs solid.”</p>

<p>Molly wanted to see if Marta remembered how the
cabbage was dressed the last time, and left her to it.</p>

<p>When the vegetables were ready the fricassee was
taken up, the chicken and veal laid in the centre of the
dish, the oysters round it, and the strips of pastry at the
four corners.</p>

<p>Now the whites of eggs were stirred into the <i>fondue</i>
gently; it was poured into a small buttered dish, which
it only half filled, and was put to bake while the first
part of the dinner was eaten.</p>

<p>“This will be done as soon as it is golden brown, and
you must bring it to table <i>at once</i>, as it will fall if left
standing.”</p>

<p>Molly meant to have dinners that were as little trouble
as possible on Monday, feeling that as it was washing
day Marta should have less to do; therefore the bill
of fare was only</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Chicken and Oyster Fricassee.</i><br />
<i>Cabbage.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Potatoes.</i><br />
<i>Fondue.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i>Peaches and Cream.</i><br />
</p>

<p>She had also bought again a forequarter of lamb, so
that she might see how far Marta had profited by her
instructions. She would vary the cooking somewhat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but the cutting and arrangement of the joint would be
the same. She noted in her account-book that evening:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>MOLLY AND MRS. LENNOX ON THE RUFFLE QUESTION—FRICASSEE
OF MUTTON—CABBAGE AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Marta</span>, unpromising as her appearance was, had
shown considerable aptitude for cooking, but about the
house generally she was rather hopeless. She had succeeded
already in breaking two of the pretty ornaments
Molly had on her bureau, and therefore the latter had decided
to trust her to touch nothing that required careful
handling. She was hopelessly mixed, too, about laying
the table. The breakfast was laid as for dinner, and <i>vice
versa</i>, and the result was that Molly did not depend on
her to do either, it being easier to do them herself.
When she had kept house a few years longer she learnt
that to do things herself was, in spite of the proverb, the
way <i>not</i> to get them done well by any one else. But
the trouble was so slight she did not think it worth
while to struggle against it.</p>

<p>She meant to have exactly the same dinner as last
Tuesday, only she had shoulder of lamb roasted instead
of breast. She stood by while Marta cut the shoulder
out, and then read over the recipe for tomato soup, and
lemon pie, pastry for which was left from the chicken
pie made on Saturday, and then left her to cook the dinner
alone, while she went to Mrs. Lennox according to
her promise.</p>

<p>She found that lady busy ironing. She looked white
and exhausted, and yet there was a large pile of little
clothes all trimmed by the mother’s industrious fingers,
and, alas, trimmed so much.</p>

<p>Yet who could not understand a mother’s desire to
see her children dressed prettily, when it cost only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
few hours more time, a little more fatigue to make them
so? and how few are able to blend beauty and strict
simplicity, although when it is blended the result is more
charming than any dictate of fashion?</p>

<p>“Let me help you iron for an hour. We need not
begin cooking just yet, if you saved the mutton broth,
as there is no gravy to make.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saved it, but you mustn’t think of ironing,—please
don’t.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it. I am not expert, but every little helps,
and your instruction will do me good. Let me go on
with that ruffle, while you get something I can’t do.
My Marta is ironing to-day, but by the look of things
I’m afraid I shall have to learn, myself, in order to teach
her, if she proves teachable.”</p>

<p>“Ironing I have learned to do pretty well from necessity.
I only wish I had been brought up to do
everything, it would all have come so much easier to
me.”</p>

<p>“But it seems to me you can do so many things well,”
said Molly. “You sew so beautifully, and this ironing
would shame most people who have been brought up to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can do anything I make up my mind to do;
so can most people, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that is why if an educated woman is forced
into unaccustomed fields of work she does it better than
those who are professedly working-women,—better in
every case where sinew is not the chief desideratum.”</p>

<p>“Only,” rejoined Mrs. Lennox, “she works with
brains and hands too, and that is why the work tires her
so much more than those who work mechanically.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. I am a strong young woman and
have never known a day’s sickness, yet I am tired to
death after a couple of hours in the kitchen, while
Marta, who has been doing the hard work and has
been on her feet hours longer, is fresh, and has to go
on working while I can rest. Yet that thought makes
me very tolerant of a servant’s shortcomings, seeing my
own limitations.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly was busy ironing the ruffle of a child’s petticoat
as she spoke, and Mrs. Lennox said, partly in explanation
perhaps: “I dare say you think I’m foolish to trim
my children’s clothes and make myself so much work;
but if you use cheap materials they look really quite
mean without it. Mr. Lennox constantly quotes the
beauty of simplicity, and points to the pictures of English
children, as if I couldn’t see the beauty as well as he.
But simplicity is costly or dowdy. A shilling calico or
crossbar made ‘Kate Greenaway’ fashion would look a
poverty-stricken effort, while in linen or fine nainsook
or India muslin they are charming. Flimsy materials
won’t hang well unless they are trimmed; at the same
time I do think I am wearing myself out for the sake of
appearance, and often resolve that I will never make
or iron another ruffle.”</p>

<p>Molly had no experience as a mother of a family to
offer poor strenuous Mrs. Lennox, whom she found a
much brighter and more sensible woman than she had
at first supposed. Yet she felt that the ruffle question
was a very serious one.</p>

<p>“I hardly dare say anything about the matter, because
I have so little experience, but I do feel that you are
not strong enough to do such ironing as this; and yet, as
you say, poor material plainly made looks mean. How
would it be to give up wash goods for every-day use
and wear dark blue flannel for a while? Even wealthy
people do that at the seaside, and one flannel frock
will cost no more than the four calico ones that take its
place.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of it, and I do believe I will make
an effort another summer; but when you’ve so many
children the frocks come down from one to another, and
the only one I have ever to get <i>new</i> for is the eldest,
but next year I’ll get her a flannel frock and see how
it works; but though light flannel is really cool, she will
fancy she’s hot if she sees her sisters in cotton.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ll tell me where your cold meat is, I
will show you how the cold mutton may be made a very
nice dish.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The meat and broth were soon before her, and by her
direction Mrs. Lennox peeled and sliced two large onions
and put them on to boil.</p>

<p>“What vegetables did you intend having?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been so busy ironing that I did not think of
anything but potatoes, though Mr. Lennox does like a
second one.”</p>

<p>“I see you have cabbage in the garden, and corn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the corn is too old, and the cabbage there
is no time for; besides, we have it so seldom, because I
have to cook it in the morning so that the terrible smell
may be out of the house before Mr. Lennox comes home,
he is so fastidious; though, I must say, the smell of cabbage
is something any one not fastidious might object
to.”</p>

<p>“How long do you boil it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, two hours, sometimes more.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind my boiling it to-night?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox stared. She had some confidence in
Molly, yet cabbage for dinner—and it was now after
five—was something absurd.</p>

<p>“But it won’t be done.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I see the kettle is full and boils. I am
quite sure you won’t believe me unless I show you; but
I do assure you there is no unpleasant odor about, cabbage
boiled as the English boil it, and in Europe it is
considered the most wholesome of vegetables.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox listened politely.</p>

<p>“I will get a cabbage, of course.” She left the
kitchen for the purpose, and Molly smiled. She knew
Mrs. Lennox was thinking what others less polite had
said to her, “but <i>we</i> like our cabbage very well done,”
as if Molly must prefer it half raw.</p>

<p>Molly had cut from the bones of roast and boiled mutton
quite a large dish of meat, and the onions being tender
she poured off the water from them, put to them a
table-spoonful of butter and one of flour, with salt and
pepper. As she was stirring them about, Mrs. Lennox
brought in the cabbage, and cutting away leaves and part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of core as Molly directed, laid it in water, and half filled a
good-sized pot with boiling water and set it on the range.</p>

<p>“For your six-o’clock dinner it must be well drained
and go into that water at half past five.”</p>

<p>“I obey unquestioningly, but I confess to strong
doubts as to whether we mean the same thing by boiled
cabbage”—laughing.</p>

<p>“I know we don’t,” said Molly maliciously. “Will
you look at this? I am going to pour in a half pint of
the broth, which I find you did flavor with vegetables.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m not so ungrateful as to neglect your instructions,
after the success of our Saturday night’s dinner.”
(It should be mentioned that on Sunday Mrs.
Lennox had come to tell Molly how good it was, and
how much enjoyed.) “There was some left, very little,
and a little kidney from yesterday’s breakfast; the children
did not take any of that. This morning I warmed
both together with a very little of that broth, and they
made another good breakfast, and I felt that I had
achieved something.”</p>

<p>“That was a splendid idea; so few people think what
two or three odds and ends put together will do, though
each may be so little as to be almost worthless alone.
Real economical management lies in this <i>dovetailing</i> one
thing with another. This is what English and Americans
know so little, and the French so well.”</p>

<p>“I see that sauce is now like onion sauce, but less
white.”</p>

<p>“It is onion sauce, made with broth instead of milk.
Now we will lay the meat in and leave it to steep in this
sauce at the back of the range, where it will keep at
boiling-point but not boil. The last thing, add a tea-spoonful
of vinegar or a few capers.”</p>

<p>Now the cabbage.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m waiting for that miracle,” said Mrs. Lennox,
coming with it in the colander, after shaking the
water well out. “I shall lay the blame on your shoulders
if Mr. Lennox’s olfactories are offended; he will
forgive you anything, since through you we have lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
better and spent a dollar less in three days. There is
nothing truer than that the way to a man’s heart is
through his stomach.”</p>

<p>“Then we must take that path,” said Molly merrily.
“The cabbage needs a table-spoonful of salt added to
the water and a scant half tea-spoonful of soda.”</p>

<p>“I shall wait and see the success of the cabbage,”
added Molly, laughing, when she had seen it boiling furiously,
“although the meat is done, so I may iron another
piece or two.”</p>

<p>Both took up their irons, and after a few minutes Mrs.
Lennox exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“It is positively true!”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“That cabbage has no disagreeable smell.”</p>

<p>“No, but it would have if you left it on the stove to
cook slowly for an hour or two. It is the long <i>slow</i>
cooking in <i>little</i> water that ruins it and all green vegetables.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox now prepared to lay the cloth, and when
she returned to the kitchen Molly had taken up the cabbage
and pressed it. It was bright pale green, streaked,
where the heart was, with creamy white.</p>

<p>“Is that the cabbage? and is it done?”</p>

<p>“Try for yourself. You see it is far more tender than
when slowly boiled, and is marrowy as spinach.”</p>

<p>“So it is; but how did you find it out?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. I was told by an English lady. I had
noticed that all English cooking-books gave twenty minutes
to half an hour to boil cabbage, while ours always say
two hours. And I noticed, too, it was never alluded to
as a coarse, rank vegetable, and I asked an explanation
from her, and she also told me she dared not eat cabbage
here, for fear of indigestion; but I never yet found
any one who believed me when I told them cabbage
should only be boiled twenty-five minutes, nor can I
induce them to try it. They all think that I prefer
half-raw cabbage. Now I leave you to dress it as you
like, for I must run home.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall just put pepper, salt, and butter on it, it looks
so pretty,—and to think there is only a pleasant odor!”</p>

<p>When Molly reached home she found Marta looking
very scared.</p>

<p>“What is wrong?” asked Molly, sure that some
disaster had occurred.</p>

<p>Marta silently pointed to the soup, which looked like
pink curds and whey; then, turning rather sulkily to the
stewed tomatoes, she evidently expected to be scolded.</p>

<p>Molly said nothing for the moment, but opened the
oven and found the shoulder of lamb beautifully brown,
and other things doing well; she was heartily glad there
was something to praise.</p>

<p>“You’ve made a mistake with the soup, Marta; but
everything else looks very nice. That meat is done as
well as I could do it. Now, in the first place, you were
in too great a hurry. The milk and tomato were only
to go together the last thing, but that hasn’t caused the
milk to curdle. You cannot have read your recipe
over as you made it, and have forgotten the soda?”</p>

<p>“No, I put the soda in.”</p>

<p>Molly felt she could not be speaking the truth, but
when she tasted the soup, found she was.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t understand this. Tell me exactly
how you did it.”</p>

<p>Marta rehearsed her movements and then it turned
out she had put the soda in <i>last</i>, <i>after</i> the tomato, and of
course it had curdled before that. She explained this,
told her to strain the soup, and then went to prepare the
table quickly, for Harry would be home in a minute.</p>

<p>On the whole, although the soup was a failure, Molly
was satisfied with Marta’s first unaided efforts. The
lemon pie, in spite of her own admonition to handle the
paste very little, she had pressed with her thumb round
the edge, to make it <i>smooth</i>, no doubt. The consequence
was, the paste was nice and short, but bore no resemblance
to puff paste, either in appearance or in eating,
but Molly had not expected anything better, and reserved
comments until the next time, when she would
again show her how to use pastry.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>PREPARING TO SAVE WORK—BROWN THICKENING—WHITE
THICKENING—CARAMEL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> had resolved to take the first opportunity to
prepare two or three articles for her storeroom which
would simplify work for Marta, and indeed she herself
had felt the lack already of these very articles.</p>

<p>Brown thickening saves a great deal of standing over
the fire and stirring of butter and flour together, when
it is ready, and if thickening of soup or stew is intrusted
to inexperienced hands, it often results in something
very different from what it should be, while with ready-prepared
thickening (<i>roux</i>, the French call it) a blunder
is less possible. The ironing being out of the way then
on Wednesday, she resolved to make that and several
other things, or rather to superintend while Marta carried
out her orders.</p>

<p>“Marta, put half a pound of butter in a small
saucepan or bowl to melt, and while it is doing so,
weigh and sift half a pound of flour. Skim the butter;
now pour it off carefully from the milk that has settled
at the bottom into another small thick saucepan, and
stir it into the flour. Keep on stirring till it is bright
brown. Watch carefully that it doesn’t burn; that is
almost dark enough. In saying ‘bright brown’ I mean a
rich, pale golden brown, not dark like coffee. Now put
it into this little marmalade jar, and when it is cold lay a
piece of paper on the top and put it away for use. It
will keep for months, and when I tell you to thicken any
brown gravy, use this for the purpose instead of fresh
butter and flour. The flavor is richer than any hastily
made thickening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we will make some white thickening. Wash
out the saucepan, melt the butter, half a pound, just in
the same way. Now stir in it half a pound of flour;
keep on stirring as long as you can, before it begins to
change color. It must <i>not be at all brown</i>, yet the flour
must be well cooked. Therefore stir it in a cooler
spot than the other. When the flour no longer smells
<i>raw</i>, put it into a small bowl. Cover as you did the
other and put it away. This is for white thickening,
for fricassee or to dress vegetables, etc.</p>

<p>“Now wash the saucepan again, and we will make
some caramel for coloring. Put in it a cup of sugar and
a quarter cup of water. Let them boil till the syrup begins
to change color, then watch it carefully. Tilt the
saucepan from all sides so that it may get equally brown.
The moment it is all nearly black, but before it chars in
the least, put to it a cup of boiling water; take care of
yourself, for it sputters a good deal. Now let it boil till
it is all dissolved and like very dark syrup. A tea-spoonful
of this, or less, will give a fine color to gravy or soup
if not dark enough in itself. It will also color icing for
cake or custard, and in fact is always very useful.”</p>

<small>MARKETING—APPLE PUDDING—LIVER AND BACON—BRAISED
BEEF—BOILING PUDDINGS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly reached her butcher’s next morning,
Wednesday, she was surprised to find Mrs. Lennox
there, and by the way she hastened to the door to greet
her it was evident she was waiting for her.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come here, and I am going to
enlist under your banner, so you must tell me what to
buy and how to cook it.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear me!” cried Molly in consternation.</p>

<p>“Do you mind? I beg your pardon, I ought”—</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not that, but it’s such a responsibility.
Suppose I advise something you don’t like?”</p>

<p>“If you did it wouldn’t be very dreadful, but I don’t
believe you will. I only know we’ve enjoyed every
meal since Saturday, and I’m nearly a dollar in pocket.”</p>

<p>“If that is really so I shall have something to suggest
in colder weather. You see I know nothing of your
tastes.”</p>

<p>“I believe we like a good many things we don’t have,
but anything outside of steak and chops will be a welcome
change.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to liver and bacon, and, as it is so
inexpensive, have a nice apple pie or pudding with it.
Do you like liver?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Mr. Lennox protests I do not cook it
right.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we take one—a lamb’s liver”—</p>

<p>“Lamb’s? I always get calf’s.”</p>

<p>“I think you will find this quite as nice and less expensive,—and
I believe I will take one myself. Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
used to anathematize the liver at breakfast in the boarding-house
so vigorously, for being cooked in thick slices
like steak and whitey-brown in color, that I think he
will enjoy it now.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that is the way mine generally is. Now
what shall I get for to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“If you had not had mutton so lately, I would suggest
Irish stew; but what do you say to a pot-roast of
beef,—or, to be finer, we will call it ‘braised beef’?”</p>

<p>“My dear, we have nothing but mutton and beef, so
an Irish stew will be very good; and I certainly want
to know how to make it well.”</p>

<p>“Still, I advise the small pot-roast to-morrow and an
Irish stew later.”</p>

<p>“Very well, either will be good. Now what meat
shall I get for it?”</p>

<p>“Three pounds of <i>thick</i> flank—of beef.”</p>

<p>The butcher handed out a thin piece nearly all fat.</p>

<p>“No, no, that is not the part; have you not the flank
with a broad piece of lean running through it?” asked
Molly.</p>

<p>The butcher now produced a piece of meat about four
inches thick, three of which were lean.</p>

<p>“That is it.”</p>

<p>It was ten cents a pound. By Molly’s direction Mrs.
Lennox got also half a pound of fat bacon, and her expenditure
was:—</p>

<p>“Now we have meat for two days, for about what
I have always paid for one.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll have something for breakfast, you’ll
find.”</p>

<p>“The great thing will be the variation of our old
routine, and the money-saving; but can’t you just <i>tell</i> me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
how they should be cooked, instead of coming yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will write out the recipes and send Marta
with them.”</p>

<p>“And the apple pudding.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, you have suet in the house? Well, make a
crust exactly as you did for the pot-pie; roll it out half
an inch thick. Grease a bowl well and lay the paste in
it, letting what is to spare hang over the sides; fill it with
pared and cored apples cut small, and put over them two
table-spoonfuls of sugar and a little water. Wet the
border of the paste and gather up the overhanging sides,
pinching them all together, so that there is no chance
for juice to escape. Then dip the centre of a cloth in
boiling water, flour it and put it over the pudding, tie it
firmly with string just under the flare of the bowl, so
that it will not slip up; bring the four corners of the
cloth up over the top of the pudding and tie them.</p>

<p>“Before you begin to make the pudding, set a pot,
that is large enough to boil it in, on the stove, half full
of water; when it is fast boiling, put the pudding in and
let it boil up quickly again, and boil for an hour and a
half without stopping.”</p>

<p>“But I suppose the water must not cover over the
top of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, yes; so long as the water <i>boils</i> there is
no danger of its getting into the pudding. As soon as it
stops it begins to soak; that is why so many boiled puddings
are heavy and soggy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never knew that. I knew they were often
heavy, but not why. I rather supposed it was because
they were boiled in too much water, and so it got into
them.”</p>

<p>They had talked along the quiet village streets, until
Molly’s door was reached, and half an hour afterwards
Marta ran across the road with the two following recipes:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pot-Roast or Braised Beef.</span>—Remove the skin
and some of the fat from the flank of beef (put both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the oven with half a pint of water to “try out”), sprinkle
the beef with two level tea-spoonfuls of salt and half a
salt-spoonful of pepper, a table-spoonful of finely-chopped
parsley, if you have it, and a scant tea-spoonful of thyme,
also, if you have it. Roll up the beef tightly with these
flavorings inside, flour the meat and put in a thick saucepan
or pot with a wine-glass of vinegar and two cloves.
Cover very closely, and if the lid of the saucepan does
not fit well put a clean cloth over it. Let it so remain
till nearly browned, turning it about occasionally. Have
ready a carrot and half an onion sliced, and when the
meat has been <i>slowly</i> cooking nearly two hours, put
them to it with half a pint of boiling water and a dessert-spoonful
of Worcestershire or any nice table sauce, <i>if
you have it</i>, and simmer very slowly two hours longer;
then take up the meat, remove the strings, carefully
skim all fat from the gravy which pour over it.</p>

<p>In summer put a pint of young peas into the gravy;
fried potatoes are very good with this dish.</p>

<p>N. B. You will observe I have said with regard to
some of the flavorings “<i>if you have it</i>.” I mean by that
they are not <i>necessary</i>, but a great improvement; and,
as they cost very little, if you want plain dishes made
savory it is economical to have them always in the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liver and Bacon.</span>—Wash the liver, dry it, cut it
with a sharp knife into slices the third of an inch thick.
Dip each slice in flour. Cut some bacon in thin slices,
remove the rind and fry it crisp but don’t burn it; then
lay in the liver, only enough to cover the bottom of the
pan; when nicely brown turn each slice; brown the
other side and take it up on a hot dish with the bacon
around it. Now if the fat is not burned (and to prevent
that, it should be fried where the fire is good but not too
fierce) stir into it a scant dessert-spoonful of flour, mashing
all the brown bits and lumps with the back of a
spoon; when it is all a <i>fine brown</i>, have a cup of boiling
water ready, and pour it quickly into the pan. Stir till
smooth. Let it boil down till thick as good cream, season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with pepper and salt and a tea-spoonful of vinegar
or Worcestershire sauce, and pour it over the liver.</p>

<p>If by chance the fat was burned pour it out of the
pan, for it would make a <i>bitter</i>, <i>black</i> gravy, and spoil
the whole. Put into the pan a dessert-spoonful of butter
and one of flour, let them get <i>quite brown</i> stirring
the while, when proceed with water as before.</p>

<p>If you have ready-browned flour in the house it saves
standing over the fire waiting for it to brown in the fat
or butter, and as you may like to prepare some I send
directions. Of course whitey-brown gravy is very disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown Flour</span>, for thickening gravy quickly. Sift
half a pound of flour into a dripping-pan and set it in a
hot oven. Look at it occasionally and stir it well, taking
care it does not burn; when it is the color of coffee
that is half milk, or pale <i>café au lait</i> color, take it out
and put it in a tin for use. You will require a third
more of this to thicken than of raw flour.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>ROLLS—BAKED LIVER—CROQUETTES—WHAT WAS
THE MATTER WITH THEM—HOTCH-POTCH.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Marta</span> had twice made bread very satisfactorily, and
Molly thought she might now show her how to make
plain rolls; therefore she had told her to save out a
piece of her bread dough, about a pint bowl full, and
when she returned from taking the recipes to Mrs.
Lennox, Molly was ready to show her how to make
them.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock, and Molly reckoned they would be
warm for dinner if made now.</p>

<p>“These are going to be quite plain rolls; when you
succeed in these we will try finer ones. Get a good
table-spoonful of butter,—lard would do, but I use it as
little as possible for health’s sake—put it near the fire
to warm a very little; add to the dough two tea-spoonfuls
of sugar; now the butter is pliable, work it in; it will
take five minutes’ constant kneading to make the butter
and dough quite smooth. Now you see it is softer than
bread dough; if a crisp crust is wanted, work in gradually
a little more flour, almost a table-spoonful,—if the
weather is cold have it warm; if a soft crust is preferred
leave it as it is. Put the dough to rise in a warm
place behind the stove, but not too hot, or it may sour;
in from two to three hours it will have risen again very
light; work it over thoroughly for three or four minutes
till it is again as small as now, and set it to rise
again, and when light come and tell me.</p>

<p>“This evening we shall have bisque of oysters, baked
liver, and croquettes, and you can make a peach pudding
by your recipe, but I want you to use cold lamb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for croquettes; I will prepare it before I go out of the
kitchen so that it will be ready whenever you are, and
remember if you forget anything to come to me.”</p>

<p>Molly cut the meat from the cold shoulder of lamb,
removed every bit of skin and gristle, and then chopped
it very fine; she had not left that to Marta because
she might not be careful enough. She also flavored the
meat by using a bit of onion as large as a dime chopped
till as fine as sand, and a tea-spoonful of parsley, also
chopped fine, and a pinch of thyme; these were mixed
with the lamb, and Marta was told to do the rest as if
making croquettes of chicken.</p>

<p>Molly intended asking her friend, Mrs. Welles, to
come and stay a week with her soon, and as that would
entail a little extra expense, she meant to economize
somewhat for a week or two; therefore she omitted
some little items from her bill of fare, and substituted
others that would be cheaper. This interfered very
slightly with her plan of letting Marta do alone nearly
all that she herself had done the last week.</p>

<p>The girl would be able to make croquettes with one
meat as easily as another, and although for the sake of
practice she meant to repeat the dishes, she did not care
to have them in the same order. The bisque of oysters
she would have in place of clams for the sake of variety
and of showing Marta that the principle was the same in
both, and that another time she might substitute lobster
instead of either, and yet the process would not change.
Another thing she had in mind was that as the breast of
lamb she had for Thursday would be a rather slim dinner,
the oyster patties, of which Harry was extravagantly
fond, would make up.</p>

<p>Soon after one o’clock Marta came to say that the
rolls had risen, been worked down, and were now light
enough, she thought, to <i>push</i> down.</p>

<p>When she went into the kitchen she found the dough
just about as light as bread should be.</p>

<p>“No, Marta, this is not light enough. Rolls should
rise a great deal lighter than bread. They will need to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rise another half hour—but as I see the oysters are
here, I will use some of them for patties for to-morrow’s
dinner.”</p>

<p>Molly took a third of the pint of oysters, and then
half a gill of the liquid, and scalded both for a minute;
then, taking out the oysters, added an equal quantity of
milk to the liquor, and in another small saucepan put
two tea-spoonfuls of butter, the same of flour; and, stirring
them together till they bubbled, she poured milk
and oyster liquid to them, stirring till they were quite
smooth. She seasoned this sauce and then dropped the
oysters, each one cut in four, into it. She did not mean
to use them to-day, but the oysters kept raw would not
be good; cooked in this way they would be as good as
when fresh.</p>

<p>The rolls being now light Molly stuck her fingers two
or three times downward into the light mass, and it
sank under them.</p>

<p>“This is what you are to do, Marta, when I tell you
to ‘push the rolls down;’ do this twice or three times
after they have been <i>twice</i> thoroughly worked over—take
notice, only lightly stick your fingers in, to let out
air; don’t knead them at all, nor try to make them
smooth; leave them just so; they come up again very
rapidly after the first time, and this is the secret of having
rolls of a close, exceedingly light texture, that will
have no doughy inside.”</p>

<p>An hour later the rolls had risen and been pushed
down three times, and Molly, after working them all
over again, took a little piece of butter on her hand,
broke off bits of the dough as big as an English walnut,
and rolled them between her buttered palms, and then
dropped each on to a greased tin two inches apart.
They were set to rise till they would be like small balloons—each
quite double the size it was when first
made. They would perhaps take three quarters of an
hour to rise, but Molly cautioned Marta that she could
not go by time in bread-making, for that differed so
constantly; in summer it would be less, and in winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
more; the degree of heat in the kitchen would make
the greatest difference; also, some kinds of flour rose
more quickly than others.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed Molly had forgotten Mrs.
Gibbs; she had her and her family in mind when she ordered
the liver. The neck end of her lamb this week
she was going to make into a nourishing Scotch broth,
and out of the dollar, of which she had spent only fifteen
cents as yet, she bought ten pounds of rye flour
and five of white.</p>

<p>This would provide bread for a month, and as the
poor woman was yet so weak, Molly meant to have it
made at her own house for the present.</p>

<p>When the rolls were light enough to bake, they were
brushed over with white of egg. The chicken pie on
Saturday, it will be remembered, had only taken part of
the white left from the forcemeat balls; the rest was
beaten with a tea-spoonful of water and set in the ice-box
for just such an occasion as this, and was now
used to brush over the rolls.</p>

<p>While the rolls baked, Molly prepared the liver for
the dinner, and told Marta to make the Scotch hotch-potch
for the Gibbs family.</p>

<p>“Cut the meat up in pieces; put it in a saucepan with
two onions, half a small cup of Scotch barley, a carrot
and a turnip, a quart and pint of water, and a tea-spoonful
and a half of salt; in an hour shred up a quarter of
a cabbage and add it. Let it all simmer for two hours
and a half, or until the barley is very soft.”</p>

<p>Molly, while Marta was doing this, washed and dried
the liver, cut about a dozen strips of fat pork as thick
as her little finger, and with a narrow knife made many
incisions through the liver and then inserted the pork.
When all was done she floured it, sprinkled a little salt
over it and it was ready for the oven.</p>

<p>When the liver was cooked—it took just half an
hour in a hot oven—it was taken up, put on a hot dish,
and a half cup of boiling water poured into it; round
the pan was a great deal of thick glaze; this was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
rubbed off and dissolved in the gravy; a tea-spoonful of
Worcestershire sauce was added and a pinch of salt, and
then the gravy was poured over the liver.</p>

<p>The dish was a great success. Harry, without an
idea that it had cost but ten cents, cut it in slices a
quarter of an inch thick, which, where mottled with the
pork and the rich brown gravy, gave quite an air to the
homely viand. The bisque of oysters Marta had managed
very nicely, and also the peach pudding, all but the
foaming sauce, which Molly had shown her how to
make; it was a good sauce, but did not foam; the only
real fault was with the croquettes, which were like sausage
meat and not at all creamy. Molly made no comments
at the time, knowing that a much more experienced
cook often made no better, but next morning she
meant to find out where the mistake was.</p>

<p>“Did you notice, Marta, that the croquettes last night
were not quite right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were harder, but I went exactly by the
directions.”</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me just what you did, and then
we will see where the mistake came in. You managed
everything else so nicely.”</p>

<p>Marta repeated the recipe correctly and Molly was
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you did just as you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Then show me how you measured half a pint.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there it is; you have really only a little more
than a gill. Did you measure like that yesterday?”</p>

<p>Marta confessed that she had, and the puzzle was
solved, and more understandable still when Molly saw
what she called a table-spoonful of flour; it was really
near two, for she had used the large kitchen basting-spoon,
and used it heaped.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I want to tell you something. You
are anxious to cook like the man cook you once knew;
that is, you want everything you do to turn out always
right, and they will only do that by your being very exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
about measuring and weighing. A tea-spoonful
more or less seems a trifle, and yet it will spoil many
things. Remember, if you have a recipe that calls for a
table-spoonful, it means just that, if the recipe is good
for anything, and half a pint is exactly that measure
<i>full</i>, not partly full.</p>

<p>“Gouffé, the celebrated French cook, who wrote a remarkable
book for other cooks, was so particular that
he explains exactly how much he means by weight
when he says ‘a pinch of salt,’ and he directs one to
weigh each carrot and turnip for soup till one’s eye is
accustomed to the sizes.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>RYE BREAD—OYSTER PATTIES—KNUCKLE OF VEAL,
À LA MAÎTRE D’HÔTEL—A SAVORY DISH.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> knew the virtues of rye bread; and in perfection,
as had she eaten it once in her life, she had enjoyed
it much,—it had been so sweet, so light, and
seemed to have the quality of never getting stale. She
knew that to some people rye bread represented a loaf
that cut like liver, that was sweet in flavor, but in
wheaten bread would have been called heavy; and to
others it was a sour, dark bread, much approved by
Germans. But that rye bread need be neither of these
she knew well, but she had no recipe. Then she remembered
Mrs. Merit and her experience; perhaps she
could help her with rye bread, as she was a famous
economist.</p>

<p>She therefore paid a visit to her neighbor, and after
a respectable amount of small talk broached her subject.</p>

<p>“Rye bread! laws yes—when my family was large
we had it, because it don’t cost more than half as much
as wheat flour does, and it’s as easy to make as mush.
You just make a thick batter of one third white flour,
two thirds rye; stir into each quart two tea-spoonfuls of
baking-powder—and bake.”</p>

<p>This was a new recipe to Molly, and she meant to try
it some day; but for the Gibbs family, she was satisfied
that a properly yeast-leavened bread would be more
wholesome, and she therefore resolved to see what she
could do. She had quite a library of cook-books, but
rye bread for general use did not seem to be in them.
On thinking it over she couldn’t see why rye bread
should not be made in the same way as white. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
she went to work to make it exactly as white bread,
making a sponge with a pint of white flour and half a
cake of yeast, dissolved in a pint of warm water, a table-spoonful
of sugar and two tea-spoonfuls of salt. When
this was as full of holes as honeycomb, she put to it two
pints of rye flour and used as much warm water as
would make all into a <i>soft</i> dough. She kneaded it, but
began to understand why it was usually stirred, for it
stuck to her hands like bird-lime, and to use flour
enough to free them would, she knew, spoil her bread.
She worked on, regardless of stickiness, and when it
was mixed divided the dough in three, put it in tins to
rise, and when each was double the first size, they were
baked in a very moderate oven one hour.</p>

<p>When they were done Molly saw she had attained
the secret of her friend’s bread, for it was sweet,
spongy, and with a tender crust. She kept one loaf for
her own use and sent the rest to Mrs. Gibbs, with the remains
of the liver made into savory collops, as follows:
It was chopped fine, and an equal quantity of bread
crumbs added, a quarter tea-spoonful of powdered marjoram,
half one of thyme and pepper and salt; to these
were put a few scraps of cold fried bacon and a little
cold ham left from Wednesday morning’s breakfast, both
chopped fine. The mince was just moistened with
broth (from boiling down lamb bones with an onion),
and a table-spoonful of flour stirred with it. Molly then
made it into three good-sized balls, put them into a
small, deep pan, poured in the rest of the broth, and put
them to bake in the hot oven for half an hour.</p>

<p>It may be thought Molly was taking great trouble for
Mrs. Gibbs. She knew that, and had she had it in her
power to give money enough to be of substantial service
to a destitute family, would not have done it. In this
case, as with her husband’s income, she looked on her
time as money, since by it she could make a little money
go far. A dollar given to Mrs. Gibbs would have done
little—bought bread for a week, perhaps, and a meal or
two besides; the liver sent round to her cold would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
been eaten so, and been miserable and insufficient for a
dinner; the neck of lamb the same; but by the time, not
an hour after all, she had double the value of what she
could give, and the bread she would make from the flour
would last three times as long as baker’s bread. In addition
to this she went to the house where she bought
her cream and asked what they did with their skimmed
milk, and was told they made it into pot-cheese when
they had much, but half the time they gave it away;
she then obtained a promise that they would give Mrs.
Gibbs two quarts a day if she sent for it. Being sure
of milk, Molly felt that the best thing she could do now
was to buy ten pounds of corn meal and send it to them
for mush. This exhausted the dollar, and beyond making
the bread and sending an occasional meal, to be concocted
out of something that would not much enlarge
her own expenses, she knew that she could do nothing,
but did not despair of interesting others.</p>

<p>Molly did not want to let her little lecture on croquettes
grow cold in Marta’s mind, and therefore meant
to have them again very soon. To that end she made a
tour of the butcher-shops in Greenfield, of which there
were several, in order to find, if she could, a knuckle of
veal. This would kill two or three birds with one stone.
Veal is not plentiful in September, yet is sometimes in
market, and for the knuckle she knew she would have
to pay very little, for in this country it is looked upon
as only good for stock, while in Europe it is very
choice. She was fortunate enough to get one; it was
quite large, that is, the meat was not cut too far down,
and because of this extra size she paid twenty cents for
it instead of the usual fifteen cents. She also bought a
piece of salt pork (very sweet, which she could tell by
the pinkish fat) for twenty cents, and four lamb’s kidneys
for breakfast for five cents. So surprised was the
Greenfield butcher at her wanting them that at first he
had seemed to think they were hardly worth a price;
evidently he did not know that they were quite a dainty
in the fashionable markets of New York, and as Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
would not eat beef kidney, but was very fond of others,
she made up her mind to have them often.</p>

<p>The knuckle of veal was to be boiled the next day very
gently, in just water enough to cover it, for two hours,
with a small turnip, a bay leaf, and a carrot, an onion,
and a bouquet of sweet herbs. The pork was to be
cooked in the same water, and served to eat with the
veal, which would have a rich parsley sauce poured over
it, fried potatoes and fried smelts.</p>

<p>Molly thought it a good plan to have fried fish, instead
of soups, or boiled fish, every day when the rest of the
dinner was boiled.</p>

<p>From the veal there would be the stock for soup, and,
as there would be more meat than would be eaten, what
was left would make croquettes. She did not mean to
have them for dinner so soon again, but for breakfast.
The practice for Marta was what she wanted.</p>

<p>Molly had some “rough puff paste” which she intended
to use for the oyster patties. She rolled it out
half an inch thick, then with a biscuit-cutter cut several
rounds; these she put one on another three deep, and on
each pressed a smaller biscuit-cutter half way through.
She had cut twelve rounds of paste, which made four
patties (three rounds or layers to the patty), and each
had a circle (cut with a small cutter) on the top layer.
These were put on a baking-tin and brushed over with
a feather dipped in white of egg, and put in the oven,
which was very hot, yet not likely to scorch. To try
the heat Molly put in her hand and began to count seconds;
when she had counted twenty she was forced to
take out her hand, and knew the oven was right.</p>

<p>While she waited for them to bake, she proceeded to
finish the oysters for filling, first telling Marta to beat
up the remaining white of egg with a little water, and
put it away for use.</p>

<p>The yolk was just what was needed for the oysters.
She strained them from the sauce, which she put on to
boil; then when quite boiling and smooth she dropped
the oysters in (it will be remembered they had been not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
more than scalded yesterday), and in about two minutes
they were firm, yet not shrunken. She took them from
the fire and stirred in the yolk of an egg, already
whipped, with a tea-spoonful of the cold sauce. They
were thick before, but immediately became thicker as
the heat cooked the egg, and the sauce was now about
the consistency of the cream filling used for cream cakes
or éclairs.</p>

<p>By this time the patties were baked. They were
more than three inches high, and after they had been
out of the oven a short time, Molly carefully removed
the centre of the top layer marked out with the small
cutter, and laid it aside, for it was the cover of the patty;
then with a small coffee-spoon she scooped out the half-cooked
paste from the centre, and then replaced the top.
They were now ready to be filled, but as they would
have to be made hot for dinner she did not fill them, as
the paste would be burnt up before the inside would be
warm; she therefore directed Marta to stand the oysters
in boiling water a few minutes before serving them, and
keep them stirred, and to put the patty-cases in the oven
at the same time; let them get thoroughly heated, and
when both were hot, put the oyster filling in them with
a spoon. Molly gave these directions for the moral
effect, but, having strong suspicions that Marta would be
unequal to such neat-handed work and might cover the
outside of the patties with the filling, saw to that part
herself before going to the table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>MR. AND MRS. BISHOP BECOME MEMBERS OF A DRAMATIC
CLUB—CROQUETTES OVER AGAIN—WHERE
THE MISTAKE LAY—WHITE SOUP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> and Molly had talked over the matter of the
dramatic club, and whether they could afford to join it.
Molly was old enough, not being a school-girl bride—did
I ever mention that she was twenty-four?—and had seen
enough of the world to know that, although a woman’s
ideal of married life may be to sew in the evening,
while her husband reads to her, or, if he is weary, to read
to him while he rests, a man very often prefers something
more exhilarating. Although Harry had never seemed
bored by a tête-a-tête evening, she remembered that he
had never yet been subjected to the long uninterrupted
quiet of country winter nights, and she wanted to run no
risk of him finding their life humdrum. He was not a
reader in the true sense of the word,—that is to say,
he read for amusement’s sake. If the book he read was
not to his mind, he threw it aside, or fell asleep over it,
and he was not so fond of reading aloud as Molly could
have wished. However, this was one of the little disappointments
most women, and some men, have to put
up with, and she was thankful there was nothing worse.
It is true that, finding Harry cared less for reading than
herself, she had devoted herself to chess, of which he
was very fond, and their evenings seldom passed without
having the men out; but Harry was too much in sympathy
with his wife not to know that chess, to her, was a
sort of loving pleasure, and had often pretended disinclination;
therefore the prospect of a weekly social meeting
and the many little entertainments that would grow
out of it was, for Harry’s sake, a pleasant one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are the actual expenses?” she had asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but from what Framley said, I imagine
these are merely nominal, outside the entertaining of
the club, which falls to every one’s share once in the
season.”</p>

<p>“Yet as we are so limited in money matters, we can
run no risks; what would be nominal to people with
double our income may be serious for us. I think I
had better wait and see Mrs. Framley.”</p>

<p>That lady called before Molly had been quite two
weeks in Greenfield; she was very handsomely dressed,
but of rather formal manners, which Molly came to know
were natural to her, and rather a distress to herself.
After the usual chat of a morning call Mrs. Framley
said:—</p>

<p>“I believe Mr. Framley spoke to Mr. Bishop about
our reading-society. Mr. and Mrs. Winfield were members,
and as we limit the club to fifteen couples we
thought it would be very pleasant if you and Mr. Bishop
would take their places.”</p>

<p>Molly colored a little, hesitated, then said:—</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me the exact conditions and expenses?”</p>

<p>“Well, there are no particular conditions, except that
no member is admitted that is not acceptable to all.
Your names were proposed by Mr. Winfield and warmly
welcomed; the expenses are nominal.”</p>

<p>Molly smiled. She had braced herself to be quite
frank.</p>

<p>“But what is nominal? I may as well tell you our
income is little more than sufficient for our needs, and
we cannot risk incurring expense that may be quite beyond
us.”</p>

<p>“But there are several of our members who are in the
same position, and for that reason we made a few rules
at the start so that our club should not break up, as so
many have done, on the rock of emulous hospitality.
The actual expenses have never exceeded $2 each person
for the winter, and have oftener been under a dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and a half. This is outside the cost of entertaining.
Every member having a house is supposed to have the
meeting once in the season, and as all our members are
householders, and some very hospitable, when anything
occurs to make such reception inconvenient it is gladly
taken by some one else; but as some are much wealthier
than others, a rule was made that no ice-cream, oysters
or bought cakes were to be allowed, only sandwiches,
tea, coffee and home-made cake, and I am glad to say
one lady, one of the most wealthy, has nothing but
home-made wafers and coffee.”</p>

<p>“Then I think Mr. Bishop and myself can accept the
membership with an easy conscience, although I hardly
see what acquisition I can be, for I cannot act. I don’t
know whether my husband has any talent that way.”</p>

<p>“I think you may have hidden your light,” said Mrs.
Framley, politely, “but at least half of the members are
honorary and only give us the pleasure of their presence;
in fact, I myself am only an onlooker.”</p>

<p>“Then I will have courage. When is the next meeting?”</p>

<p>“Next Wednesday, at my house, and I am pleased to
think your first evening will be there.”</p>

<p>Molly thanked her, and soon after Mrs. Framley rose
to go.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall see much of each other, Mrs. Bishop.
Mrs. Winfield told me we should have a great deal in
common, being both devoted to cooking-school.”</p>

<p>Molly responded suitably and Mrs. Framley left.</p>

<p>Molly had made some mixture for croquettes early in
the morning, going minutely over every detail with
Marta, using cold veal with a slice of the boiled pork,
chopped together very fine, in place of chicken. Some
of the stock in which the veal was boiled, which was
now a firm jelly, was used, and as there was no cream,
Molly used half a gill of milk to the gill of stock, and
an egg beaten; the milk and stock were stirred to the
butter and flour (see recipe for <a href="#Chicken_Croquettes">chicken croquettes</a>) and
boiled till thick and smooth, the meat and seasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
then added, and when it was all hot, the beaten egg.
After this was in, the mixture was only stirred one minute,
and then taken off the fire, the object being to bring
the whole to boiling-point, but not to curdle the egg.
The mixture was put out on a dish and set to get cold
and firm, and Marta told to make it into croquettes according
to her recipe.</p>

<p>As Molly was very anxious that Marta should thoroughly
master the art of making croquettes, she had intended
to oversee the forming and frying of these, which
were for her lunch; but Mrs. Framley’s visit had interfered,
and when she went to the kitchen she found
Marta had one croquette on paper in the colander and
was fishing in the hot fat with her skimmer.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Marta?” asked Molly, although
she could guess what had happened.</p>

<p>Marta pointed to the top of the fat, which was covered
with crumbs of meat, and lifted two empty shells of
croquettes from it.</p>

<p>“I see what has happened, Marta, but don’t be discouraged.
You have some mixture left, and you must
do this over again for breakfast to-morrow. I can tell
you the reason of this accident, and once we know the
cause of a failure, it can easily be set right. Had it
not been for that one perfect croquette I should have
said that the fat might not have been hot enough; that
is a frequent cause of croquettes bursting,—they have
time to melt inside before the crust is formed, but in this
case the fault has been in the size. You must have
made them too large. Don’t you think that one, which
is perfect, was smaller than the others?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was. I was afraid that one was too small.”</p>

<p>“It was just right, you see, and after this I think
you’ll know. Before you put that croquette mixture
away, Marta, keep out a large tea-spoonful, and after
luncheon I will come and make some balls for soup.”</p>

<p>The veal stock Molly had carefully skimmed and
strained in the morning, and intended to have a white
soup for dinner. There was about a quart of strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
jelly. One pint she put aside. It was so valuable that
she did not mean to use a tea-spoonful more than necessary;
the pint, with half a pint of milk, would be all
that was required for soup; but as she had neither
asparagus tops nor mushrooms nor celery to put in it,
and veal soup is apt to be a little insipid without, she
decided on forcemeat balls, made in the following way:
To a large tea-spoonful of croquette mixture she added
one of finely chopped parsley, as much thyme as would
go on the end of a penknife, and a dessert-spoonful of
bread crumbs; she beat an egg, and used enough only
to make the whole into a soft paste; this she seasoned
rather highly with pepper and salt, and made into little
balls not larger than marbles, and they were set away
till wanted.</p>

<p>As the soup was one Marta could not be expected to
make, Molly went into the kitchen herself, half an hour
before dinner, to do it; indeed, although she had left
the cooking to Marta pretty much, she could not risk
Harry’s comfort by waiting for the dinner to straggle in
as Marta would have had it. This seemed her chief
failing, an inability to see the necessity of dishing up
quickly. After she had cooked a thing well, she ran
the risk of spoiling it by her slowness in getting it on
the table. No mishap had yet occurred, because Molly
was on hand to rescue; but white sauce was left in the
saucepan with risk of burning, and vegetables, after they
were dressed, the same; but Molly hoped that, in a few
weeks, seeing the importance she herself attached to
time might have its effect on Marta.</p>

<p>The pint of veal stock, flavored, it will be remembered,
with the vegetables boiled in it the day before,
was put on to boil, and in a small saucepan she put a
table-spoonful of butter and a scant one of flour, and
stirred them together till they bubbled. She allowed
them to cook together <i>for a minute</i>, stirring all the time,
and called Marta’s attention to the fact.</p>

<p>“The white sauce you made last, Marta, although
very smooth, had a little raw taste; this was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you added the milk before the flour was cooked sufficiently
in the butter,—you put it in as soon as it bubbled.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid it would burn.”</p>

<p>“Of course you must not let it do that, but you see,
once it bubbles, I draw the saucepan to a cooler part
and stir till the flour is on the point of changing color,
then I quickly add the milk or broth. The sauce will
be an ivory white instead of the rather dead white that
even fairly good sauce often is.”</p>

<p>She poured the stock to the flour and butter and
stirred till smooth, and then added half a pint of milk,—“and,
as I have no cream, Marta, I kept the egg left
from the forcemeat balls—I used very little of it—to
add to this soup the last thing, just as you do for the
bisque of clams.” While the soup was all coming again
to the boiling-point at the back of the range, Molly
dropped the tiny forcemeat balls into boiling water, let
them simmer half a minute, then strained them out and
added them to the soup; then, with a caution to Marta
not to let the egg curdle, she went to add a few touches
to her toilette before Harry came home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>BROILED LAMB’S KIDNEYS—MRS. LENNOX STARTLED—CORN-BEEF
HASH.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly had said Marta was to make croquettes
for breakfast, she had forgotten that she had kidneys in
the house; but, remembering it before she went to bed,
she told Marta she would come down and broil them
herself, which she accordingly did, knowing kidneys are
very easily spoiled by bad cooking.</p>

<p>She split each kidney down the back, or thick side,
but did not sever the core or membrane, so that when
opened they lay flat, but still in one. Then she ran a long
skewer through the centre bit of fat and brought it out
again, in such a manner that the kidney lay open flat
<i>under</i> the skewer, which was attached to it only by that
stitch through the middle; then a second kidney was run
on in the same way till they were all threaded, the
skewer lying across them all; but nowhere did it pierce
the flesh of the kidney. This arrangement prevents the
kidneys’ curling up in unsightly fashion and secures their
being equally cooked.</p>

<p>They were laid on a hot gridiron, and a dish and
plates made very hot to receive and serve them on; and
while Molly cooked them, Marta carried in breakfast,
for kidneys are things that are spoiled by waiting.</p>

<p>She turned them often for about four minutes. During
the process she had put in the little dish that was to
receive them a piece of butter the size of a butternut, a
level salt-spoonful of salt, a little pepper, and a tea-spoonful
of Worcestershire sauce. When the kidneys were
done they were removed from the skewer, and each well
rolled in the hot butter and seasoning. They were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
enough cooked in that four minutes for the gravy to start
when the fork pricked them; if over-cooked they become
tough.</p>

<p>“Kidneys!” cried Harry, as Molly removed the
heated vegetable-dish-cover she had used to send them
unchilled to table. “Dear Molly, where do you scare
up these metropolitan dainties in the wilds of Jersey?”</p>

<p>“Nothing so easy; actually, the butcher throws them
in with his tallow, and seemed surprised that I wanted
them.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid such ignorance can’t last,” said Harry
“and when he finds lamb’s kidneys are really very desirable,
he will value them accordingly.”</p>

<p>“No, not until he has customers who do; and I suspect,
although the man I buy from sells good meat, that
he is not the fashionable butcher of Greenfield.”</p>

<p>“They are cooked to a turn, Molly.”</p>

<p>“I am glad. I should have had them on toast in the
orthodox way, but knew you preferred fresh bread.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mrs. Lennox came with her work-basket
to sew, while she paid Molly a visit.</p>

<p>“I want to have a little talk with you, but can only
spare the time if I bring some darning with me, so you
will excuse me.”</p>

<p>“I am glad, for I also have my sewing,” she said,
and she colored a little as she displayed a dainty little
garment.</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Lennox; and there was congratulation
in the tone, although she said no more.
“You have done me so much good since I have known
you, Mrs. Bishop, that I feel I may trouble you a little
further about my affairs without exhausting your patience.”</p>

<p>“You certainly may, if I can do anything.”</p>

<p>“I must seem a perfect ignoramus to you, and yet
I’m an old married woman and you’re a young one;
but the fact is, I was married directly after I left school.
I knew nothing of housekeeping, for my mother had
been such an invalid that we always boarded at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
time. Mr. Lennox was full of hope that he would rise
to great things,—all young writers are,—but, unluckily,
the hard times of ’73 came, and the magazine of which
he was sub-editor, and which he hoped to edit, succumbed,
and ever since then he has been forced to plod on, at
what insures us bread. He has never dared to try for
better things, and I know he frets at seeing me so overworked,
and has been telling me for years if I would sew
less, and cook more, I should be better; but first one
must ‘know how’ to cook, and I don’t. There is one
thing, however, I <i>do</i> see now, that I never did before;
and that is, that if I give my time to preparing the food,
I can save enough to get the sewing I cannot do done
for me. I never realized this before, but now I do.
This is Friday, and we have lived nicely—I mean we
have had food we enjoyed, and I have spent $2 less;
and the sewing I should have done in the time I have
cooked would not have amounted to one full day’s work,
which I can get done for a dollar.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you see it so. I was sure of it, and I am
sure that the effort to do so much sewing and the housework,
too, is far more wearing than double the quantity
of either alone would be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, because I dread to lose a minute, and the cooking
always seemed such a loss.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you have not thought it cheaper to keep a
servant.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox dropped her work in her lap, and looked
at Molly in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Cheaper! why, I should feel I was ruined at once.”</p>

<p>“Let us talk it over a bit, and see if my idea is right
or yours. You pay a woman to wash?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I spend $8 a month in getting help, a dollar a
week for washing, and the other dollar I divide between
the heavy ironing and roughest cleaning; the rest
I do myself.”</p>

<p>“And the ironing that is left is quite a day’s work?”</p>

<p>“Well, it takes all my spare time on Tuesday; and I
have been running down so much lately, that I am afraid
I cannot do it through next summer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly looked at her. She did, indeed, look as if she
were worn out. She could understand that doing all
the work for her family, washing, even, included, was
nothing extraordinary for some women; but for this
one, with her ambition to dress her children prettily, not
to <i>look</i> poor as well as <i>be</i> poor, her fastidious husband,
and her bringing-up,—it was an effort that was wearing
her out.</p>

<p>“Now this is the way I reckon,” said Molly. “You
can get a strong, newly landed girl, for six or eight dollars
a month. She may have nothing but health and
industry, although I have known girls as capable as
those who ask more, but more self-distrustful. Will not
such a girl do more to help you for $8 the month than
you get now for that money?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes. It seems to me if I had only some
one to wash dishes every day I should be easy; but
you forget the food.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not; but, really, if you have time to
give your own attention to that, and you would have
then, your food would cost less, even with one extra to feed
than now. It would not be so if you had to get an extra
large steak or chops each day for that one, but with the
varied cooking you could then practice, you would find
it make only such difference as you can easily make up
in some other way; for instance, you use baker’s bread;
make it at home, and the difference in cost will be more
than your girl will eat of it; then, as all children like rye
bread, use it once or twice a week. You will make your
expensive flour go much farther. Then if rye is not liked,
or they get tired, use one week Indian and wheat bread,
another, rice bread. I don’t think your husband or children
would consider these breads anything but a treat, or
know they came cheaper, and I should say nothing on that
point till you found out their real tastes. One thing I
don’t want to advise; and that is, the providing of any
unpalatable or unwelcome food, be it ever so wholesome
or cheap. Food eaten without relish is <i>not</i> wholesome;
and that is why, unless <i>time</i> is given to cooking, the coarser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
parts of meat are not economical, because they require
careful cooking. A hurried, slap-dash way of preparing
any part of meat spoils it. Only the finest steaks or
chops are eatable, when so abused; but it requires all
their excellence to make them so.”</p>

<p>“I am taking in all you say. You have startled me
wonderfully about the girl; and the way you put it makes
it seem as if it would be almost cheaper.”</p>

<p>“It would be as cheap, and your health would be better.
You may not be lucky enough to meet with a good girl
at first; but we all run that risk, and I am sure of one
thing: if you should give double the wages you would be
equally exposed to it, and I am in favor of taking girls
who have nothing to unlearn. I went on that plan with
my Marta; and, although she is not all I could wish, I
don’t think I should have done better by taking one
who professed to know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you could; but she seems to me an
exceptional girl.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately for me, she has a fondness for cooking,
and seems thoroughly respectable; but, if I had more
work in my house, I should not be able to keep her; so
I am hoping you may be able to find one equally good
and a little quicker, if you resolve to make the trial.”</p>

<p>“I would like, but I am afraid. I have always heard
that a servant increases the expenses out of all proportion
to what she eats.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if servants are left to themselves in their
inexperience, they waste far more than they consume;
but you will oversee everything.”</p>

<p>“And then I shall get the reputation of being dreadfully
stingy.”</p>

<p>“What matter? You might be wasteful, and still be
called so by those who wish to do it; but economy is not
stint. I am sure you will never look more keenly after
odds and ends than I do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox looked incredulous.</p>

<p>“It is true. If there is <i>one</i> potato left I have it put
away; <i>one</i> spoonful of rice, a fag end of beefsteak. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I am new to keeping house in this country, I am
an old housekeeper; for my mother left everything to me,
and, our means being small, and she fastidious (by which
I mean only that she could do without anything, better
than have it second rate), I had to set my wits to work;
and I’ve too often known the time when <i>one</i> potato was
just the thing to finish, or make her a little dish, to despise
it.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>Molly laughed. “Impossible to say, for one never
knows what may happen; but I can tell you what it
once did. My mother and I lived alone, and so rarely
had joints of meat that we seldom had much more than
enough in the house for our needs, in the way of fresh
meats, but potted dainties we always had. However, one
wet, chilly evening, a visitor arrived unexpectedly, an
American traveling, and he had come considerably out
of his way to see us for a half an hour. I was at my
wits’ end, for our solitary maid had her holiday, and we
were about to sit down to a cozy cup of tea and toast,
with some anchovy paste and a little fruit. All we had
in the house was a few slices of corned beef, not presentable,
for they had been cut off for tea the night before.
Now I knew our friend expected no dinner; and to give
him as good a one as a French cook could send up would
be no treat, for he was leading a hotel life. The only
thing he would really enjoy would be some real American
dish. There was little time, for he had to catch a train
in an hour. I flew down-stairs in despair. I must have
something hot to set before him. I looked at the safe;
there were about a cup of cold mush, a solitary potato of
good size, and a few half-dried scraps of corned beef. I
took them all into the kitchen, blessing the French charcoal
stoves, which are always ready, and, arranging the
oven for baking, I chopped my beef, then the potato,
not too fine. When done there were a cup of beef and
rather less of potato. I put some beef-dripping into a
pan, and set it to get hot; and into a saucepan put the
beef and potato mixed, and a little salt and pepper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
stirred them round; and then I added a small half cup of
thick cream. While this was heating, I cut the mush
in slices, floured each, and when the dripping was smoking
hot I laid them in; I tasted the hash, and found it just
right. There was no time to brown it; but I left it long
enough for the cream to dry sufficiently away, while I
beat the yolks of four eggs and the whites to a stiff froth,
then added to the yolks a little salt and three table-spoonfuls
of milk, stirred the whites to them gently, and then
took up the hash. The mush, which I had turned, was
now pale brown; and I laid it round the dish on which
was the hash, then poured the fat from the saucepan, put
a bit of butter in it, and when it melted, which, as the pan
was already very hot, it did in a moment, I poured in the
eggs. Happily, the table was ready, and my mother
always made tea on it; so I waited only to split a few
pickled gherkins to garnish the hash, and then my omelet
being half set I put it, pan and all, in the oven, while I
carried my Yankee dish to table. I had been absent
only twenty minutes; everything was ready, and, while
the traveller’s tea was being poured out, I ran down
and doubled my omelet over and turned it out. I am
quite sure nothing short of canvas-back ducks, or New
England turkey and cranberry sauce, could have been
such a success as that hash.”</p>

<p>“‘Dear Mrs. Holmes,’ our friend said to my mother,
‘I assure you I have dreamed of corned-beef hash and
fried mush, and longed for them many times when the
table has been groaning with every French dainty, and
believed I could not hope to eat them on this side of the
Atlantic.’</p>

<p>“Since that time I never think anything too small to
save; it comes in when least expected; and, had my
cooked potato not been there, I could have made no
hash.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said that Molly was providing for visitors
by economizing slightly in her table. She was always
economical, but it made some difference whether the fish
she bought was the inexpensive flounder, made by the
art of good cooking into the aristocratic <i>filet de sole</i>, or
what passes for such where veritable sole is not to be
bought for money, or a more expensive sort; whether
she used veal instead of chicken, or clams in place of
oysters, and tomato or potato salad for lettuce. On
Saturday, after Sunday’s marketing was done, her account

<p>This made the week’s expenditure 23 cents less than
the last week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Monday’s dinner was
formed, with the addition of oysters, from what was left
on Sunday; and therefore the lamb bought on Monday
did not come into use till Tuesday, when three chops
were used for breakfast, and the shoulder for the evening
dinner.</p>

<p>Substituting, then, the lamb for the steak of the Tuesday
before, and on Wednesday using lamb’s liver in
place of the roast breast which was used on Thursday, the
bills of fare were substantially the same as those of the
preceding week, until Friday, when stuffed lamb’s heart
for breakfast, and corned beef and flounders and beets
for dinner, were new items, as was also the steak for
Saturday, in place of the cutlets. Dessert and puddings
of the first week were repeated.</p>

<p>Twice Molly had found in market green corn young
enough for their taste, and had bought half a dozen ears.
The beets, also, were moderate enough in price now to
come within Molly’s purse. Needless to say, all articles
which were expensive, only because too early or too
late in season, had to be eschewed; but in autumn, in
the country, where vegetables are rarely so plentiful as
in New York, the market needs watching. One grocer
may have a stray basket of string beans, quite young, or
a few dozen of sweet corn, long after they have disappeared
generally; and these are often quite cheap.</p>

<p>Molly had chosen a cheap part of corned beef—the
plate—in preference to the round, at double the price:
properly boiled, she liked it better. A small piece of
four or five pounds of round of beef is very dry, even if
the careful boiling prevents its being hard; therefore she
got four pounds and a half at eight cents. She knew,
from her cooking-school experience, the New York
price was seven cents; but she had learned that most
things were a little dearer in Greenfield. As she wrote
down the recipes for cooking the heart, the corned beef,
the flounders, and steak, I give them in that form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb’s Heart Baked.</span>—The heart, which came
with the lamb’s liver, instead of being cut up and fried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in dry rings, as it is usually done, was cleansed of blood,
the gristle (or “deaf ear”) cut away, and a veal stuffing
made of a heaped table-spoonful of bread crumbs, a small
tea-spoonful of parsley chopped very fine, and a pinch,
between thumb and finger, of thyme, pepper and salt.
Make this into a paste with butter by working a piece the
size of a walnut into it, then fill the cavity in the heart
with it; cut two thin slices of fat pork, wrap the heart
in them, flour it and put it in a hot oven, in a small
dish. Bake it twenty minutes, turning often so that it
will be quite brown. Take it up, pour into the dish a
<i>very little</i> boiling water or gravy (Molly had some of
her veal stock), season nicely; if water is used, add a few
drops of sauce or catsup; stir it well round the little
dish to remove dried gravy, then serve with the heart,
which thus makes a very appetizing dish.</p>

<p>The corned beef was washed, and, as the butcher had
told Molly it was only moderately salt, she did not soak
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boiled Corned Beef.</span>—Although it was quite a
small piece, Molly intended it to come so very slowly to
the boil that she had it put on the stove in cold water
at two o’clock. The water was only at the boiling-point
at three, and it was kept till six so slowly cooking that
one had to look carefully in order to see that there was
any movement in the water at all. At six it was taken
up, and the bones drawn out, the rough edges trimmed
off, carrot and turnip cones set round it, and boiled cabbage
served with it. After dinner, it was put between
two dishes, and two heavy flatirons set on it, and it was
allowed to get cold under pressure, in order that it might
cut in neat slices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Beets Boiled.</span>—The beets to be carefully
washed, the roots <i>not cut off</i> at all, and the tops left an
inch long; the idea is to prevent the skin being broken
in any way. Put them in boiling water, and, if they
are of average size, one hour will boil them tender.
Try, without a fork, by pressing in a cloth; then pour
the water off, and peel and slice them (or they can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
left whole if preferred), and make the following sauce:
A dessert-spoonful of butter, a scant one of flour; let them
bubble one minute, put to them a scant half-pint of water;
let it boil, season with pepper and salt, and then put
in a large tea-spoonful more butter; stir till mixed, and
add the juice of half a lemon; put the beets in this
sauce, and let all come to a gentle boil together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Bone Flounders</span>, and prepare as <i>filet de sole</i>.
Take a flounder weighing as near two pounds as possible,—if
too small they will make poor filets,—have
the head removed, lay it on the board before you, and
with a sharp knife make a cut right down the middle of
the back, from neck to tail, letting the knife touch the
bone all the way; then run the knife carefully between
the flesh and the bones, working always towards the
edge or fin, and keeping close to the bone; you have now
detached one quarter of the flesh. Do the other side in
the same way, and when the side uppermost is thus entirely
loose from the bone, turn the fish over, and do the
same with the other part. You will now find you can
remove the bone whole from the fish. You have now
two halves of the fish; cut away the fins, and you have
four quarters of solid flesh, or filets. Lay each one, skin
downward, in front of you; hold the end of the filet
firmly, and with the knife cut the filet from the skin by
pressing the edge of the knife downward <i>on the skin</i>,
which you hold firmly with thumb and finger, and <i>pushing</i>,
as it were, the flesh up from it. You will find the
skin and flesh will separate without destroying the shape
of the filet. Now bread them; have either a good supply
of bread crumbs dried in the oven and <i>sifted</i>, or
cracker meal; beat an egg with a table-spoonful of water,
lay each filet in it, both sides, then lift it out and lay it
in the crumbs; turn it over that both may be well covered,
and press gently; then lay it aside, and do the
other three. Have enough fat in a deep pan to cover
them; let it get very hot, trying it with a bit of bread.
If it brown <i>at once</i>, put the filets in, two at a time; have
brown paper ready, and lay them on it when they are a
fine golden brown, and serve on a hot dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stewed Cannelon of Beef, or Rolled Steak.</span>—Take
a piece of the upper side of the round of beef, cut
broad and thick. Make a veal stuffing in the following
way: A cup of fine bread crumbs, a scant table-spoonful
of finely chopped parsley, and a very scant tea-spoonful
of thyme and marjoram mixed (if any one objects to
either of these herbs, leave it out), a very little nutmeg,
a half tea-spoonful of salt, and a half salt-spoonful of
pepper; chop or mix all together with a good table-spoonful
of butter; lay the steak on a board, and with a
large knife hack it <i>closely</i> across and across, all over on
one side only, then along the centre of the hacked side
lay the stuffing; roll the meat over and fasten it with
toothpicks to keep it, while you envelop it in thin slices
of fat pork, round which you wind twine. When neat
and compact, lay it in a saucepan with a pint of water,
and a piece of carrot and onion cut fine, a salt-spoonful
of salt, and a tea-spoonful of vinegar. Let this <i>simmer</i>
very gently for three hours, closely covered, then take
it up, lay it in a baking-pan, remove the strings and
toothpicks very carefully, dredge it all over very thinly
with flour, and set it in a very hot oven to brown
quickly. If the saucepan was kept closely covered, and
the simmering slow, there will be at least half a pint
of thick, rich gravy in it; which strain, and skim free
from fat (a table-spoonful of cold water thrown in will
make it easier to skim). When the meat is brown, pour
this gravy round it, and serve. If the gravy should
have dried away too much, a little boiling water may be
put into the saucepan, and well stirred, before straining,—but
a <i>little rich</i> gravy is better than much and poor.</p>

<p>This dish Molly prepared herself, and it was a great
success. Harry pronounced it better than <i>filet de bœuf</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is either a very good dish, or a wofully bad
one,—hard and dry and altogether unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>But Molly knew it depended so entirely on great
care, that the meat should be hacked thoroughly, yet not
anywhere cut through, and then so very slowly simmered,
so quickly browned, that she thought it one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
those dishes she would always have to cook herself.
She was not expecting too much from Marta. If she
profited by her instructions sufficiently to know the rules
of cooking, and abide by them so far that she might be
trusted not to spoil a dish if left to watch it, and be able
to cook <i>a few things well</i>, so that she could do when
necessary unaided,—that was all Molly looked for.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>PREPARING A CHICKEN—GIBLETS—SPOILT BREAD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the beefsteak, on Saturday, was being converted
into such a savory dish, Molly, who wished to
oversee the simmering, took that time to prepare the
chicken. The one used for the pie, last Sunday, she
had prepared, while Marta was busy elsewhere; this
week she wanted to show her how it was to be neatly
done.</p>

<p>She had ordered the chicken (or rather, yearling fowl;
for it weighed over three pounds, and Molly was not
paying the price of chicken in September) to be sent
home <i>with the feet on</i>, for two reasons: first, because the
butcher usually chops them off at the joint, or above it,
when they should be taken off just below, else when
roasted the flesh shrinks up, and they display an unsightly
bare bone; and, secondly, because the feet, properly
prepared, are too valuable, for gravy, to lose.</p>

<p>Molly began by picking over the bird to remove a
few stray feathers; then she took off the stove-lid, put
some paper in the fire, and quickly moved the bird over
the flame, taking care not to blacken the skin.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, if you are ready, I want you to pay
great attention, because if you can clean a fowl you can
also clean a duck, goose, or turkey; the process is the
same, and either, improperly done, though you may remove
everything that ought not to remain in it, will
never taste the same. If the entrails are broken, it imparts
the odor of the barnyard to the whole.</p>

<p>“You see I cut the neck off close to the body, leaving
as little of it on as I can; but, before beginning to cut,
push the skin well down toward the body, so that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
will be plenty of skin to cover the place where the neck
has been. Cut off the feet just <i>below</i> the joint; then cut
the skin at the back of the neck, an inch or so down,
and with your forefinger loosen the crop all round, and
take it out without breaking or emptying it. Next cut
a slit right under the rump, large enough to run two
fingers in. If this were a goose or turkey, you would
need it large enough to admit your whole hand into the
body. Before attempting to draw out the entrails,
loosen with your finger all the tiny strings that attach
them to the body. Be certain your fingers can pass between
the contents of the stomach and the body in <i>every</i>
direction without obstruction; then bend your hand or
fingers round the mass, and draw it forward; this will
bring the whole out in a ball. Be careful not to drag it
by any particular part, or you will break the entrails,
and the whole process be an unclean one; or you may
spoil the fowl by breaking the gall, the bitter of which
cannot be washed away. Cut off the vent, which will
free the main entrail. If properly managed, the bird
will be quite clean inside, and need only wiping with a
wet cloth; if not clean, pour lukewarm water through
it.”</p>

<p>Molly worked while she talked, suiting the action to
the word when possible; and when the entrails of the
fowl lay on the table, quite unbroken, she showed
Marta the clean inside.</p>

<p>“You see this needs washing neither inside nor out;
and that is the great object,—to prevent the contents
of the entrails getting on the bird; for if they do, to
my mind, no amount of washing will cleanse it.”</p>

<p>“Now I lay the bird aside, and prepare the giblets,
which make gravy. You see this small, dark-green
bladder attached to the liver? That is the gall. I cut
it off, but am careful to leave a bit of the liver with it
to avoid breaking. Put the liver in cold water. This
hard, silvery-blue lump is the gizzard; it must be freed
from all skin and strings; and by cutting it carefully on
the <i>wide</i> side, without penetrating the inner skin, it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be peeled off, leaving the inside whole, thus avoiding
the usual mess. This outer flesh throw into the water
with the liver. Now for the feet.”</p>

<p>Molly put them in a quart bowl, and poured water
from the kettle—which she was careful to see was
<i>actually boiling</i>—upon them, covering them all over.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, if you do this yourself, never attempt
to scald with water that is not boiling, however near the
point it may be; and do not put them in hot water and
set them on the stove to come to the boiling-point.
Either of these methods will so <i>set</i> the skin that it will
not come off without the flesh, while these, you see, will
peel easily enough.” She had taken, as she spoke, a
clean cloth in one hand, and with a fork lifted one of
the feet out of the hot water, then quickly rubbed the
thin, yellow skin, which came off as readily as the skin
from a ripe, scalded tomato; then she bent back each
nail and that, too, came off, leaving the foot delicate,
white, and clean. The rest were done in the same way.
“The only thing necessary is great quickness; the skin
gets ‘set’ as the water cools.</p>

<p>“You can put the fowl away now till to-morrow,
Marta, but the giblets I will put on to stew for gravy.
Here are the feet, the heart, the neck, gizzard, and liver,
all well cleaned. They need a pint of water, a slice of
onion, a piece of carrot, as big as your thumb, cut in it,
half a tea-spoonful of salt, and a sprig of parsley. Now
if I had not these vegetables in the house, I should do
without; but having them, the gravy will be much
better. Let these giblets stew down very slowly, till
only half remains; then strain, and you will find it is a
solid jelly, when cold.</p>

<p>“Ah, Marta, what is the matter with the bread? and
how comes it so late to-day?”</p>

<p>Marta was just taking from the oven the one loaf
which formed the tri-weekly baking, and at a glance
Molly knew it was a failure. It was a peculiar color,—a
drab tone, instead of the bright, yellow brown it
should have been,—and it looked flat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“That I don’t understand,” said Marta; “it seemed
to-day as if it would never rise.”</p>

<p>It must here be said that after Molly showed Marta
bread-making, her bread had been very good. She had
made it three times so well that Molly thought that
part of her teaching was over. This was the fourth
time, and it was evidently a failure.</p>

<p>She thought of all she had heard from experienced
housekeepers,—how thankless a task it was to teach
servants, for when they attain perfection, they lack the
ambition to keep to the mark; they “run down,” as it
were. For a moment Molly was appalled at the prospect
of working so hard and faithfully with Marta, if it
was to end thus; and then she remembered, if it should
prove so in this case, it could not be possible that some
girl would not be wise enough to see the advantage to
herself of keeping up to a standard.</p>

<p>“Even if I have to change several times, at last I
certainly shall find one who repays me; then I shall
have a year or two of peace and comfort.”</p>

<p>But she did not make up her mind to the worst about
Marta from this failure. It had been gradually becoming
clear to her that Marta had some good qualities and
many faults. Whether the qualities balanced the faults
was something she had seriously to consider when she
had had longer trial; and which would depend much on
whether, once knowing a thing thoroughly, she could
be trusted to do it.</p>

<p>“Marta, nothing of this sort can happen without a
cause; try to think what it can be.” Molly studiously
refrained from showing her vexation, for she really
wanted to find out whether Marta had erred through
carelessness or ignorance; and the only way to get at
the facts was, not to frighten her into deception by
seeming angry.</p>

<p>“I cannot think, unless the yeast was not good; I
was very careful.”</p>

<p>“Get me the rest of the cake of yeast.”</p>

<p>When she brought it, Molly broke it. It broke off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
short, and smelt quite good; had it been stale it would
have pulled like dough, or smelt bad.</p>

<p>“No, the yeast is good, and in proof of it I must
make something else with it. But I think you must
have put it in too hot water.” As she spoke she had cut
the loaf. “This looks just like bread made with scalded
yeast, or that had risen too slowly from having too little
yeast.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I am sure the water was not too hot.”</p>

<p>“And it could not have been chilled when you set it
to rise, I know. Ah, there’s one thing, Marta! perhaps
you forgot to stir the yeast after you dropped it in the
water, or did not do it sufficiently, and it remained at
the bottom and never went into the bread at all.”</p>

<p>This seemed the certain solution, if what Marta said
about the water was true; but the girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, I am sure I stirred it, and it all went into the
flour.”</p>

<p>Molly looked at her,—could she be telling the truth?
If she had not known the bread had had long enough to
rise, she would have thought it had been put into the
oven directly the dough was in the pan, without being
allowed to rise; but that she knew could not be, for she
had seen it rising, and wondered why it should be so
late. She wished now she had asked before it was
baked; but Marta had been out of the way, and when
she returned to the kitchen the matter had slipped from
her mind.</p>

<p>“I have told you to warm the flour. I suppose you
didn’t make it very hot.”</p>

<p>“No; I did everything just as you showed me.”</p>

<p>Molly said nothing. Marta must be untruthful; this
was a more unpleasant thing to discover than the failure
of the bread.</p>

<p>“Well, we must have bread; it is four o’clock, and
Saturday. I will make a rye loaf, because it needs to
rise only once after it is mixed, and by seven o’clock it
will be ready to bake.”</p>

<p>Molly measured the flour and set it to warm (she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
meant to make this bread herself, because she was much
quicker than Marta). As she poured the hot water into
the cold, to make the right temperature for the yeast, a
thought struck her;—she always dissolved the yeast in
the tin pint measure, and Marta did the same.</p>

<p>“Marta, after you put the yeast in the water, did you
set it on the stove?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, the water was a little cool, and I set it
there to dissolve; but I did not let it get a bit hot, and
it was quite back of the stove.”</p>

<p>“That is the mystery then!” Molly had remembered
hearing a lady speak of having done the same
thing herself; and though it was back of the stove, and
the water could not get hotter, the yeast, being at the
bottom in contact with the hot iron, had baked or
scalded. Of one thing she was very glad; Marta had
immediately owned the fact, and the failure had not
come from her neglect of any of the rules Molly had
laid down,—only from not understanding cause and
effect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>TO MAKE A FOWL TENDER AS SPRING-CHICKEN.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I have said, the fowl was a yearling, and Molly
meant to try with it an experiment she had seen practiced
in France, by which fowls, not quite young, were
made very tender, without being converted into fricassee
or pot-pie. On Sunday morning, before going to church,
she had taken a large sheet of soft paper, and, after
twisting the wings over on the back, and forcing the
legs up against the body snugly, securing them there
with skewer and twine, and fastening the skin of the
neck neatly on the back with a toothpick, she seasoned
it and wrapped it entirely in the paper, which was large
enough to cover it twice. She then tied it up with
twine.</p>

<p>“Marta, put this chicken in the oven at half past
eleven; that is, half an hour earlier than if it were a
young chicken. Let the oven be hot, and, at a quarter
past twelve, remove the paper. Take care to let all the
grease that may be in it run into the pan; flour the
fowl a little, and set it back in the oven and roast it.
Take care to turn it often, and let it get well browned;
when you take it up, remove skewer and string, pour
the gravy from the giblets, with the liver and gizzard
chopped very fine, into the dripping-pan; set it over the
stove, season, and, if it should not look a nice rich brown,
put about two drops of caramel in it. Send the gravy
to table in a sauce-boat.”</p>

<p>Marta promised to follow directions carefully, and
Molly left the kitchen; and then, remembering a mistake
Marta might make, hastened back.</p>

<p>“I told you <i>to flour it</i>, but I mean only to shake a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
very little over it from the dredger; if it is at all thick
there will be a white, pasty coating on the outside, instead
of a crisp, brown one.”</p>

<p>After church Molly went to the kitchen to see if
everything was going right, and saw on the table a cupful
of pretty yellow balls. “What are these?” she
asked, taking one up, but found it collapsed between her
fingers. It was simply a wind ball, and the outside as
thin as paper.</p>

<p>“They are German noodles for soup,” said Marta,
her face beaming with pride.</p>

<p>“They are very pretty; and, though I know several
sorts of noodles, I have never seen these.”</p>

<p>At dinner the clear soup, with the addition of Marta’s
noodles, was excellent, and she found that steaming the
fowl in paper, before baking, agreed just as well with
the American bird as a French one; the limbs fell from
under the knife, as Harry carved, and the oft despised
yearling might have rivalled the youngest and juiciest
spring chicken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>DOLLARS AND CENTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> reached the end of her first month’s housekeeping,
and now could see exactly where she stood,
and could plan for the coming month to advantage. Referring
to her note-book, she found she had spent 53
cents less the second week than the first, 75 cents less
the third, and 60 cents less the fourth. She had, therefore,
in hand nearly $2, and provisions in the house for
a couple of days. She had also salad-oil, olives, Worcestershire
sauce, cooking-wine, pepper, salt, mustard, corn
meal, and vinegar, to last a month at least. There was
also over a pound of coffee left; and she would need
only three pounds of lard in place of five, as there was
nearly half left, and two instead of four pounds of coffee.
She had, therefore, that much to deduct from her second
month’s grocery bill, and several additions to make to it,
for she had so far done without many articles she liked
to have in the house; she found, too, that the twelve
pounds of sugar she had allowed must be increased to
fifteen, twelve granulated, three cut loaf.</p>

<p>Her order for the grocer stood for the second month
thus:—</p>

<p>Molly had carefully saved the peels of all lemons
used in the past month, which had not been grated. As
they were squeezed, the pulp was scraped out, and then
they were dropped into a gem-jar of salt and water, a
handful of salt to the quart. She meant to do the same
with oranges, through the winter, and to candy them.
A cup of candied lemon or orange peel is a great addition
to a fruit cake or to many puddings; and, as the
only cost was the sugar used in candying it, she would
always keep a good supply in her store-closet. The
alcohol was to make lemon flavoring; and, as soon as it
came, she took a fresh lemon with a coarse rind, and with
a sharp knife carefully pared off the yellow as thin as
possible; this, cut into small pieces, she put into the alcohol,
then corked it tightly. In two or three weeks this
would be very fragrant extract of lemon, growing
stronger the longer it was kept. The extract of rose,
of vanilla, and of almond, she bought of the druggist;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
they were much stronger than those put up in bottles,
and of course very much cheaper, and the ten cents’
worth would last months. The extract of rose was to
take the place of rose-water in flavoring cakes or icing;
a very few drops would suffice.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought Molly, as she surveyed her new stock
of provisions, “I can have some variety in dessert and
cakes, and these little bottles will work wonders in my
commissariat. Charlotte and I will have a real good
time when she comes.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte” was Mrs. Welles; and she was to come
the second week in October, when the hills would be in
the full glory of autumn color; and Molly was full of
anticipation of pleasure in having her old friend in her
own house.</p>

<p>“That alone pays for all the extra care and work of
housekeeping,” she had said to Harry,—“the pleasure
of asking your friends to your own house instead of some
one else’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a paying thing in every way,” said Harry.
“I confess I’m completely converted.”</p>

<p>Harry had kept up his little jokes about their housekeeping;
had laughed gently over her weekly savings,
and still more when she told him it was to meet the
extra expense of visitors.</p>

<p>“But, Harry,” she had said earnestly, “we must do
that, you know, or else get just as much behind as I am
now before-hand. Of course, if we were a large family
keeping a bountiful house, one more or less would not
need providing for; but when just two are living as well
as they know how, on a certain sum, that amount will
not stretch to take in extra. Every one who <i>manages</i>
has to calculate so; only perhaps I need not have spoken
of it. Many things are all right until they are spoken,
and then they do, I confess, <i>sound</i> very small. Of course,
if we cooked a large roast to-day, ate it cold two or three
days, baked once a week several loaves, and had large
pots of weak coffee, half to be thrown away, we should
not need to provide very much for a visitor; but we aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to live differently; and it is only by making one thing fit
in with another that we can live quite within our means,
and be able to welcome a visitor without anxiety.”</p>

<p>Molly was flushed, and her eyes sparkled; for she was
a little wounded.</p>

<p>“My dearest little woman, you mistook me; I wasn’t
laughing at the planning at all; I was laughing in admiration
at the way you steered your little bark so very
near the wind, and trimmed so very neatly. And to
think, too, how clever you were to cut down the table-expenses
after the first week without my guessing it. I
declare, I thought I was living quite like a prince. I
am lost in admiration, Molly, and feel ashamed to be so
much better off than most fellows.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a sort of jesting earnest, and pressed
Molly to him. She understood him well; the slight
cloud lifted, and, with his arm about her, they went over
the month’s accounts together.</p>

<p>“Now do you regret the experiment of housekeeping?”
she asked, when he had congratulated her.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I don’t. No more boarding for me if I
know it.”</p>

<p>“I am so thankful to hear you say that.”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear, you’ve had your little innings, listen
to mine. I have $20 a month, remember, to give an
account of. You know we set out, when we married,
with the brave purpose of reserving $10 a month for
emergencies. But with board and laundress coming to
nearly $90, and the numberless trifling expenses, car
fares, etc., in New York, in the whole twelve months we
did not save $10.”</p>

<p>“I know, and it worried me very much; to live right
up to one’s income seems terrible.”</p>

<p>“Not so terrible in our case, because I’m sure of a
steadily increasing salary; and I propose we do not increase
our expenses for some years to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed! Whatever the increase, it must be
saved so long as we have health.”</p>

<p>“Well, I find by living in the country that drain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
small expenses is avoided; and I actually have $12 in
hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so thankful, but”—anxiously—“you
have not been going without lunch?”</p>

<p>“By no means; but I find fruit or a sandwich and
glass of milk makes me as good a lunch as I want, and
averages ten cents a day.”</p>

<p>Harry’s commutation ticket was $6 a month, $3 only
of which had to come from the margin of $20. (It
will be remembered that the amount they allowed for
their rent, servants, and table was $77. The $3 saved
from their old boarding-house expense of $80 partly
paid the commutation ticket.) Harry had therefore
limited his personal expenses to $5 for lunch and newspapers,
tobacco, etc. Molly was very proud each time
she remembered how freely he had spent money before
their marriage, and how cheerfully he had resigned the
cigars and expensive luxuries that were almost second
nature, for her sake. How could she grudge any pains
that should make his house a little like the one he had
been accustomed to? They had both decided to be
very economical in dress; and it is astonishing how very
little will keep up a wardrobe once well supplied, provided
one does not easily tire of the same garments. Altogether
Molly thought the outlook was bright enough;
and, after thus summing up, they spent a long, happy
evening laying plans.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is your conclusion about our light-handed
Phyllis; will you keep her?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; she certainly is rather exasperating sometimes,
and I have thought it over seriously whether I
should take the trouble to go on with her or change; but
she has some very good qualities; she is very clean, and
very saving, and really about cooking very intelligent.
Outside of the kitchen I can’t say much for her; but
another might be stupid there, too, so I think I’ll bear
the ills I know.”</p>

<p>Marta’s wages were but $10; but Molly had found
it absolutely necessary to hire a woman for two days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that Marta might see how washing and ironing was to
be accomplished in this country, which Molly herself
knew little about. She knew what the result should be,
but how to attain it she did not know. When the woman
came, she was careful to profit, herself. She watched the
process, and asked the woman a dozen questions.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that Marta rubs enough and works
hard enough, but nothing looks just right,” she had said,
as she watched the apparently easy movements of Mrs.
Hall, who was considered an excellent laundress.</p>

<p>“Lor bless you, ma’am, it ain’t the rubbin’ with
clothes like your’n, it’s the rinsin’, and the washin’ in
plenty of water—many ov ’em stuff the tub just full
of clothes as they can pack, and then puddle them all
through in a little water one side the tub, when it’s just
as easy to have a few bits in at a time. Then when
they’re a bilin’, the biler’s chuck full, and no room for
’em to scald; and they’re put right out of the bilin’ suds
into the blue rinse water, ’stead ov bein’ suddled first.”</p>

<p>“What is suddled?”</p>

<p>“Well, just being put into a tub ov clear or near clear
water, an’ gettin’ the soap out of ’em; then they kin be
tossed into the rinse.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, it’s not the labor, but the water?”</p>

<p>“Stan’s to reason, if the cloes come out of thick water,—I
don’t mean dirty; <i>your</i> cloes wouldn’t make dirty
water if you was to try,—they’ll look thick.”</p>

<p>This was a great thing for Molly to know. She saw
the principle of it, and she knew Marta grudged no
work; it was only that she did not expend it in the right
direction. Less rubbing, but more water, then, was no
doubt the secret.</p>

<p>With ironing she learned less, Mrs. Hall’s views on
the matter being of the Bunsby kind. Molly had been
reading all she could find in books about it, but she believed
a few words from a practical laundress would enlighten
her more than much reading. She had only one
clear idea herself; and that was that the most beautiful
laundry-work she had ever seen, she had been told, was
due to long boiling of the starch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I boil it till it runs off the spoon like melted silver,”
the woman who did it told her.</p>

<p>“What do you think about starch? Ought it to be
long boiled?” she asked Mrs. Hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Some says so, some says not, but
I never makes no differ; if I’m not ready the starch
biles, if I am, it don’t. It’s all in the ironin’, I say; if
you kin iron, you kin.”</p>

<p>“But surely sometimes starch sticks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>Molly gave up; but she found Marta so far improved
by what she had seen, that the money was well expended.</p>

<p>But to return to the dollar and cent question. Her
grocery bill for the coming month was $10.02 against
$11.22 for the last (see <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX.</a>), and the weekly
proportion of that would be $2.50½. Of several articles,
such as flour and potatoes, she had renewed the
supply; not because they were really exhausted, but
would be in a few days; all of which small “lap-overs,”
however, would make a little difference to one who
watched her expenses so closely as Molly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>CHIEFLY SOCIAL—MRS. FRAMLEY’S OPINIONS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> during the month had become acquainted with
all Mr. and Mrs. Winfield’s friends; they had gone to
the “readings” each week, and, not being hypocritical
young people, but very ready to be amused, had enjoyed
themselves much. The “readings,” she found, were
really modified theatricals; and as happily no great
tragedies or legitimate dramas were attempted, but bright
comedies or farces, they were usually well done; and
where they were not the fun was greater.</p>

<p>Molly was glad they had found so many pleasant people
in Greenfield; it made the ordeal of a winter in the
country for Harry far less trying. She was expressing
an idea of this sort to Mrs. Framley, who said:—</p>

<p>“But you don’t seem to think the ordeal is as great
for you, who are in the country all day. I’m afraid you
spoil Mr. Bishop.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no,” laughed Molly; “but I do think it
right to make life just as pleasant to him as I can.”</p>

<p>“My dear, don’t you think women do too much of
that? Isn’t it just as much a man’s business to see that
his wife enjoys herself as hers to cater to <i>his</i> amusement?
You told me the other day you don’t care for
chess; yet you make a point of playing it. Why shouldn’t
Mr. Bishop make a point of doing something you like?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but I don’t believe he would think of
it; if he did, no doubt he would try to amuse me.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it! You are so self-effacing that it
doesn’t occur to him. I am no woman’s rights woman;
I don’t want to vote; but I do not believe in catering to
a husband’s taste any more than he caters to mine.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t thought much about it,” said Molly slowly.
“It just comes natural to me to do what I can to please
Harry, but I don’t know that it is any credit to me, for
I enjoy it just as much as he does; perhaps if I didn’t I
might not do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are newly married, but later you will find
you have made him thoroughly selfish; at least, he is a
remarkable young man if he doesn’t get so. Look at
Jane Carlyle!”</p>

<p>Molly laughed. “I love Mrs. Carlyle, and I am always
surprised at the tone of commiseration adopted
toward her. I think she thoroughly enjoyed ministering
to her husband—why shouldn’t she? She loved and
admired him, and it was her life work; and I think I understand
such a woman well enough to feel sure she was
happier drudging for him than she would have been
with some smaller man drudging for her. All her letters,
for the first twenty-five years of her married life,
show that she rather gloried in overcoming her difficulties.
I dare say she would have pitied some other
woman doing the same things; but we all leave out, in
thinking of others, the personal affection which makes
the things we do and suffer for those we love a pleasure.”</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Bishop,” cried Mrs. Framley, laughing,
“I had no idea you could be so eloquent. I think,
at one of our meetings, instead of a reading, we will
have a lecture from Mrs. Bishop, entitled <i>The labor
that we love physics pain</i>. You haven’t convinced me,
though, because my opinions are founded on principle,
and the conviction that women ought, out of self-respect
and for the sake of other women, to expect that a husband
should sacrifice his tastes and pleasure, and consider
it his duty to amuse and entertain his wife as much
as she does him, and not consider his duty done if he
provides for her and treats her as well as he would a
favorite horse.”</p>

<p>“I can understand if people, man and wife, or brother
and sister, begin to draw the line as to what is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
conceded and what expected, and what they do for those
they love becomes a <i>conscious</i> self-abnegation,—that
life under such circumstances may be looked upon as one
of self-denial; but I fancy few really are denying themselves
while pleasing a loved one.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Framley smiled. “You are the last person I
should have thought romantic, but I see you are; talk
to me ten years from now, my dear, and I’ll listen respectfully.”</p>

<p>Molly thought the matter over when she was alone.
Was she really in danger of spoiling Harry? She certainly
had known husbands who took all the comfort of
their homes just as their right, and never seemed to
think they need do anything toward the family pleasure
beyond paying the bills. Molly was devoted to her husband;
but she was not so blinded by her love as not to
see that Harry was in no way a perfect man. He was
pleasure-loving only in the sense of seizing life’s enjoyments,—even
his generous impulses were part of
them,—and he was too fastidious for a poor man; and
Molly could quite realize that he might not be a loving
husband to some women just as good as she was, and
yet she knew his faults were faults of temperament.
How could he help it, if he liked brightness and gaiety
and rather shirked the dreary side of life? She sympathized
so much with him that she had no dread of the
future; she had no wish to make him over to her standard.
(Herein lies the secret of half the “incompatibility”
in marriage, if Molly had but known it; but she
was not, consciously, a social philosopher.)</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it; I don’t believe Harry will be
more spoiled by being made happy in his own way than
if I try to make him make me happy in mine; and if he
does I can’t help it. It all depends, I suppose, whether
one loves a man well enough to enjoy his pleasure
and find one’s own in it; and I can’t help thinking Mrs.
Carlyle was just as happy as those who pity her, until
she got ill and morbid; the sacrifices she seemed to
make of her own comfort were not so, for her pleasure
was in promoting that of her great husband.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, Mrs. Framley’s warning had done no
good or harm. While boarding, although Molly had
been as reserved as politeness permitted, and limited her
intercourse with the ladies to formal acquaintance, it had
been impossible for her to escape many such warnings,
uttered good-naturedly, often by the way of joking a
young wife; but she knew then, as now, she could lay
no deliberate plans to secure her husband’s love and attention;
if she gave more than she received, she could
not help it—she loved to give. “If it is really necessary
to measure one’s devotion in order to secure happy
married life, then those women who love least have most
chance of happiness; but it cannot be.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A VERY PLAIN PUDDING—HOW TO COOK ODDS AND
ENDS—BILLS OF FARE FOR A WEEK.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly’s</span> enlarged circle of acquaintances enabled her
to ask aid for poor Mrs. Gibbs; and several had subscribed
small sums, which, put together, bought the poor
soul fuel for a couple of months; and others who regretted
inability to give money—having so many calls
already—gladly sent to Molly odds and ends of food,
fag ends of steak, the tops of mutton chops, etc.,
which, long and softly stewed and left till cold,—when
the fat came off in a cake which made nice dripping for
Mrs. Gibbs to fry mush or potatoes in,—then stewed
again with onions and potatoes at some times, vegetables
and barley at others, made a very appetizing dish; thus
with a very little of Molly’s time and what would have
been thrown away by one or two families, savory, nourishing
food was provided for the destitute woman and
children. Had the meat and vegetables been sent to
Mrs. Gibbs herself, they would have done comparatively
little good; they would have been fried, and the fat
probably thrown away, and the tough meat eaten without
relish. A large bread pudding, too, was made once
a week; and, as it cost so little and was so good, Mrs.
Lennox asked Molly for the recipe:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plain Bread Pudding.</span>—Soak stale bread, crust
and crumbs, in skimmed milk till soft; press out the
milk, and beat the bread fine; add a table-spoonful
of molasses, a tea-spoonful of ginger, and the third of
a nutmeg to each quart of beaten bread; sweeten to
taste; pare the yellow rind of an orange or lemon, or
both, chop them fine, and add them with one or two cups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of currants, according to the size of the pudding; put
the whole into a pan, smooth it over the top, and strew
it thickly with nice beef dripping or butter. Bake a
three-quart pudding <i>slowly four hours</i>. Better cold than
hot.</p>

<p>This pudding, if care is taken with the flavoring, will
by no means taste poor. It is especially nice cut in
slices and fried, or—in hot weather—eaten cold with
milk or cream and sugar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbs was getting now strong enough to do sewing,
and one lady lent her a sewing-machine she was
not using; Molly felt there was now some hope of her
getting work enough to partly support her family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox and Molly had often talked again over
the advisability of the former getting help in her house,
or not; Molly was strongly of the opinion that, as her
health was before everything, it certainly was advisable
and truly economical, but she did not venture to urge it,
because she knew everything would depend on the kind
of girl they would get; yet it seemed that any one with
but two good qualities, willingness and strength, must
be a great gain to a woman situated as her friend was.</p>

<p>“I do dread green girls, they generally are so stupid.”</p>

<p>“I confess they often are; so are those not green,
only they conceal their stupidity better, and often add
conceit to it; but it seems to me what you are in urgent
need of is a pair of strong arms; if you get those, you
can do without the brains, or supply them; you never
stop to ask if the woman you hire to wash and iron is
stupid or not, she simply does the work set for her; and
if one pays a girl low wages, and she does just the work
you show her, like a machine, every day instead of two
days a week, won’t you be better off?”</p>

<p>“Yes. When I think of the matter like that, I see
I should, even if I have to follow her round for a month
or so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will be saving your muscles.”</p>

<p>“And I might then get time to think of my children’s
minds as well as their bodies; my life is so sordid, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
never read a line; and when Mr. Lennox reads to me I
am sorry to say I am too pre-occupied to listen. It is a
frightful waste of life.”</p>

<p>She sighed, and on the last of these conversations
said: “Mrs. Bishop, I’ve resolved to try the experiment.
I am not so afraid of the increased butcher bills
since I have so many of your recipes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you need be; but you can easily get
an idea of what you will spend. I think it a good plan
to write out a sort of list every week; it saves thinking
each day what to have for dinner, and, of course, can be
modified according to market prices. I limit myself to
certain prices: and, if I find some articles dear one day,
I can easily change; for instance, cauliflowers have been
wonderfully cheap this fall, and twice I have got a small
one—large enough for us two—for 10 cents; to-day
I meant to have fried cauliflower, and found a very small
one was 20 cents; of course I did not get it. You
might draw up some sort of a list of provisions for a
certain time, allowing for the extra person, and get a
close idea of your probable expenses.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would help me.”</p>

<p>“I will, gladly.”</p>

<p>Later in the day, Mrs. Lennox came in much excited.
“My dear! Mrs. Framley’s chambermaid has a sister
expected to arrive from Ireland this very week, and she
is trying to get a place for her; and I am tempted to try
her. She is sixteen, and the sister says for the first
three months she will let her live with nice people for
very little.”</p>

<p>“I would by all means engage her if Mrs. Framley
thinks well of the sister.”</p>

<p>“Yes. She says she is respectable and clean.”</p>

<p>“That’s about all one can hope for, and I think it is a
fortunate chance.”</p>

<p>“I shall decide. Oh, think of my having another pair
of working hands in my house: such a weight will be
off my shoulders, and this saves me going to Castle
Garden.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly had decided to write her own bills of fare for
the week, as it would save her thinking each day, and
she could manage better, knowing beforehand all she
would need. Accordingly, on the first of the month, she
wrote out the following as her programme for the week’s
dining. The breakfasts so often came out of the dinner
that she did not need to make special arrangement:—</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>MARTA’S NOODLES—BRAISED BEEF—HOW TO ADAPT
ONE’S MATERIALS—POLKA PUDDING AND SAUCE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said before that Molly had repeated, as often
as she could, the dishes she had first taught Marta, so
that she might not get confused, and might know thoroughly
a few things. She hoped by this means to be
able to depend upon her for certain dishes. At the beginning
of this new month Marta seemed to have learned
thoroughly how to make clear soup, white sauce, bread,
and to fry; and to Molly this did not seem a bad result.
In knowing how to make clear soup, she knew the principle
of soup-making, and could make any other meat
soup,—also in learning this she had learned what <i>slow
boiling</i> really meant, and could therefore boil meat well.
To make white sauce perfectly meant to do many other
things of which that, or its modifications, are the foundation.
Whether Marta’s intelligence was quick enough
to show her the value of the key she held, that good
white sauce meant good béchamel sauce, good celery
sauce, lobster sauce, poulette and all the long list of
sauces with high-sounding French names, that seem so
hopelessly unattainable to ordinary cooks, as well as all
kinds of white soups, and many sweet dishes,—that
she would see and apply all this was a great deal too
much to hope; but if she would only keep her execution
of what she could do up to the mark, Molly would feel
that her efforts were far from wasted.</p>

<p>“If she will only not be content with having accomplished
these things a few times, and will <i>not</i> become
careless as she gets familiar, I must be very thankful;”
but this was just what Molly did fear. The bread, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
light and good, was never twice alike, unless
Molly superintended the making; which assured her that
Marta had taken to “guessing” or, what was as bad, to
measuring carelessly. Carefully she explained to her
that a pint of flour did <i>not</i> mean all that could be taken up
on a pint measure, or that a pint of water did not mean
the larger half of a quart measure; but the bread still
came to table, sometimes coarse-grained, sometimes very
close, showing it was sometimes made very wet, at others
stiff, but always light and sweet so far; but she feared
this lack of exactness might run into other things. If
so, it could not be helped. Molly knew that many
very good cooks, who turned out excellent dishes, never
measured, could never tell how they did it, or give an intelligible
recipe. Such cases had been often quoted to
her as a reason why the precision of scientific cooking,
as taught in cooking-schools, was nonsense; but she knew
that those who cooked thus, although they might produce
excellent results four times out of five, the fifth time
might make a failure; they are always subject to good
and bad “luck” with their cooking; and she knew, too,
there are a certain few who are gifted with such a correct
eye for quantity that they could calculate the
weight of a thing to a quarter of an ounce,—she herself
had this gift to a certain extent, but she never trusted
to it,—yet she understood that a cook with that exceptional
gift might do as well without weighing as with it;
the only misfortune was that the generality were not so
gifted, but believed themselves to be so, and the result
is the frequent uncertainty with which one so often
awaits the appearance of Dinah’s or Delia’s efforts, that
result depending on their “good” or “bad luck.”</p>

<p>However, Molly was convinced that she had done her
part with Marta, and that if she failed in the things she
knew, it would not be because she did not thoroughly
understand; and she could now try to teach her several
new dishes.</p>

<p>The bill of fare for the day was noodle soup, braised
beef, cabbage with white sauce, fried potatoes, and
polka pudding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>About a pint of clear soup was on hand, and Molly
had many times intended to let Marta show her how to
make the German noodles that had so pleased her when
she first saw them; but on days when clear soup was
made or used, something had always called her attention;
and even to-day was ironing-day, but she helped Marta
through with her work, so that there might be half an
hour to spare without putting the ironing back, and
then while Marta was finishing she prepared the dessert.</p>

<p>She had a recipe for polka pudding which she had
often heard praised, and now, as she had the materials,
would try. I say she had the materials; but Molly was
very clever in “cutting her coat according to the cloth.”
The recipe called for bitter almonds as well as sweet;
she knew by flavoring a portion of the sweet almonds
with the extract of bitter she would have the same effect.
Rose-water also was called for; she poured a few
drops of the extract of rose into a table-spoonful of
water, and she had it, or at least the effect.</p>

<p>The recipe was as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polka Pudding.</span>—One pint of milk, boiling hot,
two table-spoonfuls of corn starch mixed smooth in a
<i>little</i> cold milk; then pour the boiling milk on it and stir
all the time; thicken over the fire and mix, when cooked,
with a table-spoonful of rose water, a table-spoonful and
a half of thick cream; or stir in one and a half of butter,
one ounce of bitter almonds and one of sweet ones
blanched, and beaten with a little white of egg to prevent
oiling; beat the yolk and the rest of the white
with another whole egg very light. Mix all together, let
it come to the boiling-point, put it into an oiled mould,
and set in ice.</p>

<p>There were one or two peculiarities about this pudding;
it was unsweetened, except by the sauce, which
might make it a pleasant change from sweeter dessert,
and it was to be served ice cold on hot plates with hot
sauce.</p>

<p>The first thing was to blanch the almonds, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
did by putting them in a bowl and pouring water over
them, which she was careful to have quite boiling; when
they had stood two minutes, she took them out of the
water with a fork, laid them on a coarse cloth, and
pressed them between her thumb and finger, when they
slipped easily out of their skins. She dropped them as
they were done into cold water to keep them white.
When all were finished, she dried and weighed them
(two ounces of almonds <i>blanched</i> being very different
from the same weight in their skins), and then, as she
had no mortar, she took the chopping-bowl, assured herself
it bore no odor or trace of herbs, and first chopped
them fine; then with the potato-masher, which she
never used for its legitimate purpose, pounded them.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
One-half of these she flavored strongly with bitter almond
and the rest of the recipe she followed exactly, using
cream instead of butter, as she had it, having saved it
from dessert the day before for this purpose.</p>

<p>She measured the table-spoonfuls of corn starch very
carefully, for nothing is more disagreeable than too
much, and she boiled it in a saucepan set in another of
water, so that the starch might be long cooked without
burning. She removed it from the range to the table,
and allowed it to go slightly off the boil before stirring
in the eggs; then returned it to the range and stirred till
it came to the boiling-point again.</p>

<p>When all was mixed, she poured it into an oiled
mould and set it in the ice; and then prepared to
watch Marta, who was delighted with her accomplishment,
and to see it so much appreciated. Her face
fairly beamed as she found herself giving instead of
taking instruction. She said very little, but Molly
stood by and noted what she did.</p>

<p>She beat one egg till it frothed, put to it a pinch of
salt, and then worked in as much flour as it would take,
<i>about</i> three table-spoonfuls; she kneaded it till it was a
smooth and firm, yet elastic, paste. This she rolled out
on the pastry-board (very slightly flouring it) till it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
as thin as writing-paper. So far, this was exactly the
recipe for home-made vermicelli noodles, which was familiar
to Molly. When the paste was as thin as she
could get it on the board, Marta lifted the sheet of yellow
paste, laid a cloth folded on the board, and then the
paste on that; this enabled her to roll it still thinner;
then she removed the cloth and folded one-half the
paste, and asked Molly for her thimble. Molly washed
it and gave it to her, and Marta stamped a couple of
dozen little disks out of the <i>double</i> paste. They were so
closely stuck together that they looked like little circles
of yellow card. Marta now took a little pint iron saucepan,
put into it two large table-spoonfuls of lard, and set
it to get smoking hot. While this was reaching the
point of heat required, she took the little sheet of paste
she had not used, and which was still single and had
got very slightly dry, while the disks were being made,
which she explained it was necessary for it to do. She
then rolled up the thin sheet closely, and cut it at intervals
of the third of an inch; the paste now looked
like so much yellow tape; and these, she informed
Molly, were either to be dried near the fire on a sieve
and kept for soups, or to be boiled in water and dressed
with butter. As she spoke, she tossed the shreds up
lightly with a fork for some little time. The fat was
now hot; as hot, Molly remarked, as for croquettes,
proved by the fact that the little disks when dropped
into it (they became balls the minute they were in the
fat) took a pale, golden hue; one-half minute colored
them all alike; they were then lifted out with a skimmer,
and Marta laid them on a clean cloth. Molly said
nothing, because she did not want at this time to interfere
with what was Marta’s specialty, but in doing them
herself would use paper to drain them instead of greasing
a cloth.</p>

<p>“I am ever so much obliged, Marta; these are a real
novelty. Now we will have the others boiled for
luncheon and some day you can make them for dinner.
Mr. Bishop is so fond of anything of the sort. I want
to see you cook them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>It was time for them to be cooked now, Marta declared,
and she put on water to boil with a tea-spoonful
of salt in it; then she grated about a table-spoonful of
cheese, and when the water was fast boiling dropped
the “noodles” into it. She knew no other name than
this for both the balls and the ribbons. They were to
boil a quarter of an hour, she said, and every now and
then she carefully stirred them up with a fork <i>not so as
to break them</i>, but to keep them separate. She put a
large table-spoonful of butter in a little saucepan and
set it to get hot. When the noodles were strained off, the
grated cheese was sprinkled over them with a little pepper
and salt, then the butter was put to get <i>boiling hot</i>, and
immediately poured over them. They were again stirred
up with the fork, and, when the butter was well through
them, Marta pronounced them ready; it was of course
quite a small dish, but Molly told Marta if it proved
half as good as it was pretty, she would be called on to
make it very often.</p>

<p>It did not belie its appearance. “Marta, this is quite
a discovery! I wonder if you can make any more German
dainties?”</p>

<p>Marta smilingly said she knew only one or two really
nice things.</p>

<p>“Then you shall make them; but don’t you see, you
silly girl, that when you knew how to fry those little
balls you knew how to fry many other things?”</p>

<p>“I see it now, but I did not before. I thought everything
else had to be done in a different way in a flat
pan.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you make these ribbon noodles again,
you will have to take the whole of the paste made from
the egg, and double the butter dressing; for I’m sure
Mr. Bishop will be delighted with them.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, as the irons were on the stove, Molly
put the beef in the oven and made what Soyer calls a
“roast-braise.” She took a small earthen crock or pan
and put into it a large onion, a small carrot and turnip,
two sprigs of parsley and a bay leaf; on these she laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
some fat pork shaved, and on that the meat beef neatly
skewered and tied. Over this meat she put a thin layer
of fat pork, and over all a cup of water and a flour and
water paste, so that the steam could not escape. This
was to be left in the oven, which was not allowed to get
very hot for the first two and a half hours,—just hot
enough to keep the roast simmering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>FRIED POTATOES—POLKA SAUCE—CLEARING GRAVY
OF FAT—A VARIETY OF CAKES FROM ONE RECIPE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span> had intended showing Marta how to fry potatoes,
so as to have them crisp. If she gave directions
merely, the girl would naturally think, being so much
smaller than other things, they would be cooked as soon,
and the result would be brown and flabby. She had
waited to do this until some other dish needed her in the
kitchen till the last minute before dinner, and to-day, as
the sauce for the pudding had to be made, she could direct
the one while she made the other, and she was anxious,
too, to see to the taking up of the beef and making the
gravy. She went to the kitchen in good time to attend
to this. Half an hour before the meat was to come out,
the oven was allowed to get very hot. When the paste
was removed from the crock, the savory steam filled the
air. The beef was lifted from the crock, put in the
dripping-pan and set on the top shelf of the oven, now
quite sharp, for half an hour, to brown, while Marta prepared
the cabbage. The potatoes, peeled and cut into
thin slices, had been lying in ice-water since morning.
They were now drained and dried <i>thoroughly</i>, and the
kettle of lard was put on the range to heat. Then Molly
skimmed the fat from the gravy in the crock and poured
it through a strainer into a small saucepan, and she
then set Marta to rub as much of the vegetables through
as possible.</p>

<p>“Marta, you need not chop the cabbage to-night; for
a change you will press all the water you possibly can
from it, cut it across pie-fashion when it is in the dish,
and make a gill of nice white sauce, using, remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
<i>half</i> a table-spoonful of butter, <i>half</i> one of flour and a gill
of milk.”</p>

<p>Molly was draining the cold water from the cabbage
as she spoke, and put it into the boiling water; then, as
it was too soon to make the sauce, she went to arrange
the dining-table—which was something she found quite
impossible to teach Marta.</p>

<p>When she returned Marta had rubbed the greater part
of the vegetables through. Molly put a cup of boiling
water into the crock, stirred it well round the sides, then
poured it through the remains of the vegetables in the
strainer into the saucepan, and then set it on the range
to boil fast; it was still thick with fat.</p>

<p>“Marta, when that boils throw in a little <i>cold</i> water,
then skim it; do that three or four times till it is quite
clear of fat, then set it where it will boil rapidly, to get
rid of the water you have thrown in. When the grease
is entirely off it, you can stir in a dessert-spoonful of
brown thickening.”</p>

<p>Molly needed for the polka sauce one table-spoonful
of butter, well washed to remove salt, two large table-spoonfuls
of powdered sugar, and a glass of wine, and
the directions were as follows:</p>

<p>“Beat sugar and butter till very light and white, make
the sherry quite hot, add it gradually to the butter and sugar,
beating all the time, stand it in a saucepan of boiling
water, and do not cease beating till all are at the boiling-point.”</p>

<p>Molly had to content herself with beating the sugar and
butter to a very light cream and measuring the wine; she
must trust Marta to finish it while they were at dinner,
as it was evidently a sauce that could not stand.</p>

<p>When Marta had thickened the gravy for the meat,
Molly seasoned it with pepper and salt, let it boil fast
till very rich, then took it from the range and left it to
stand for a few minutes. Marta had the soup on, and the
noodles in the bottom of the tureen.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, try the fat, and put in the potatoes if it
is as hot as for your noodles. You must leave them till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the fat recovers the heat—it is of course chilled by the
cold potatoes going into it. If you were frying for a
large family you would only put in part at a time, but for
our little dish you may safely put in all.”</p>

<p>In about one minute they were drawn away from the
intense heat.</p>

<p>“That is because they take at least eight minutes to
cook. They will be tender before, but not crisp, and if
they were kept in the hottest part they would be dark
in color long before ten minutes. Understand, you must
<i>not</i> put them where they will cook <i>slowly</i>, but where
they will cook <i>more slowly</i> than right on the fire, and
you can safely make your white sauce while they cook.
As I am here I’ll take up the meat, but I want you to
notice that the gravy has still a little fat which has
formed on it like a skin, and can be lifted with a fork.
One way of clearing very greasy stock or gravy is to
boil it fast, let it stand, then remove the skin that forms,
repeating this process several times if necessary. Where
there is time, this is really the best way, for there is no
need to watch it; simply put it on the fire and remove
it as you go about your other work.</p>

<p>“Now those potatoes are done—lift them out with
the skimmer, lay them on that brown paper I have put
ready, sprinkle salt on them and then turn them into
a dish. The beef is brown now—you can take it up,
pour part of the gravy round it and put the rest in a
sauceboat. Now I’ll leave the rest to you.”</p>

<p>The polka pudding Harry pronounced delicious, and
exactly to his taste, but Molly thought she would have
preferred it slightly sweetened; but the combination of
hot and cold, eccentric as it seemed, was very pleasant.</p>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Lennox came in for a chat, as she
occasionally did, leaving Mr. Lennox at home with the
children. She wanted to tell Molly that she expected
her new maid by the next Inman steamer. Her sister
was going to meet her on its arrival and bring her right
out.</p>

<p>“Make up your mind to possess yourself in patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
for the first few days,” said Molly, “for you will no
doubt need it, and then you may have real comfort.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I think I am patient. To-morrow I am going
to make a cake; can you give me a good recipe?
Better than the one I have, I mean.”</p>

<p>“That depends on what it is. Do you want a cup
cake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the one I have is what they call feather cake,
and very light and nice, but I would like a change, I
confess. The recipe is one table-spoonful of butter, one
cup of sugar, one cup and a half of flour, half a cup of
milk, one quarter tea-spoonful of soda, half one of cream
of tartar, two eggs and a pinch of salt. Then I stir butter,
sugar and eggs together, beating them hard, then
add flour in which the cream of tartar is mixed and milk
by degrees, and I dissolve the soda in the least drop of
boiling water, and bake it in a good steady oven. I use
the same recipe for jelly cake.”</p>

<p>“I know that cake,” said Molly; “it is an old favorite,
and for a quite plain one it is very good indeed, and for
children or where it is quickly eaten up I should use it;
but I have to make a richer cup cake, using very much
more butter or butter and lard, because for one thing I
like a cake that is more like pound than sponge, and, for
another, I want it to keep fresh. One loaf made with a
cup and a half of flour lasts us a fortnight, and by using
nearly half as much butter as flour it is better the last
day than the first.”</p>

<p>“I thought so much butter would make it heavy.”</p>

<p>“No, if properly made you may use equal quantities
of butter and flour as in pound cake, or half a pound of
butter to one of flour as in queen cake; but a cake with
much butter needs more care in baking, and it takes
longer than one with less—pound cake takes from two
to three hours.”</p>

<p>“I am fond of pound cake, but I never aspire to make
one.”</p>

<p>“It is easy enough to make, but not so easy to bake;
While eggs and butter keep fairly cheap, I think I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
make one to keep, so that it will be always on hand, for
the minute eggs and butter get more expensive I shall
use as few as possible and make only fruit cake.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get eggs now while they are cheap?
I get eggs from a farmer at twenty-two cents, but he tells
me they will be twenty-five by the end of the month.”</p>

<p>“I pay that now at the store, but if I can get a few
dozen at twenty-two cents, it will be an economy to take
them. I will put them down in lime.”</p>

<p>“That is what I have wanted to do, but I tried once,
and put ten dozen down when they were fifteen cents,
and they did not keep at all.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do them together if you like; but to return
to the cake, I don’t believe you can improve on feather
cake for your purpose, but you can vary it <i>ad infinitum</i>.
By leaving out a good table-spoonful flour and adding
grated chocolate and flavoring with vanilla you have a
very nice chocolate cake, or by stirring in it a cup of
grated cocoanut or one of walnut meats it is delicious, or
even by grating the peel of an orange and part of the
juice, or lemon-peel. If you add fruit you need more
butter, say two table-spoonfuls, or it will be crumbly and
dry.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I never thought of chocolate cake. I
shall try it to-morrow.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>CANDIED LEMON-PEEL—TO WHIP CREAM SOLID—ICED
CREAM COFFEE—MADELEINE
CAKE—POTATO BALLS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day not being a very busy one for Marta,
Molly proposed to candy the lemon-peels, that had been
lying in brine until enough had been collected. There
were now the peels of nearly a dozen. These were put
on in cold water, and when they had boiled an hour this
was thrown away and fresh cold water put on them, the
object being simply to freshen them. When they began to
get tender Molly tasted them to see if any salt remained
in them, but she found them quite fresh; had they not
been, she would have changed the water once more.
When they were tender enough to run a straw through
them, which was when they had boiled nearly three
hours, they were poured off, and a pint and a half of
water and a pound and a half of sugar were put to boil
to syrup, while Molly and Marta cut the peels into chips
less than an inch long and a quarter inch wide. To accomplish
this quickly Molly told Marta to cut each half
lemon-peel into three equal sizes, then to lay one on the
other, and cut across all three; the chips were about the
right size thus cut.</p>

<p>When the syrup boiled the chips were dropped in; it
was allowed to boil again, and to keep boiling slowly till
the peels were clear, then more rapidly till there was so
little liquid that they were in danger of burning; then
they were drawn to the back of the range for the remaining
syrup to dry away without burning. When
they were at this point Molly sprinkled half a pound of
sugar through them and spread them out on plates, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Marta to put them in the oven with the door open,
and let them remain all night to dry.</p>

<p>She explained to Marta, if ever she tried to do them
alone, to remember there must be always enough syrup
to cover the peels at first, made in the proportion of a
pound of sugar to a pint of water.</p>

<p>Of course, although the process was a long one, the
only attention required was to prevent the peels burning
toward the last.</p>

<p>Molly knew she would be in the kitchen a good deal
this week, for she did not expect Marta to be able to do
much alone. The day on which she candied lemon-peels
she planned to make iced cream coffee, a cake, and show
Marta about the dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winfield’s freezer was very small, the cylinder
holding only a quart. Molly had not tried it hitherto,
but home-made ices were so economical that she was
anxious to become familiar with it. After breakfast a cup
of black coffee was made by pouring half a pint of water
through two table-spoonfuls of finely-ground coffee, in
the same way as their usual breakfast coffee was made,
only of double strength. To this was added a gill of thick
cream and half a pint of boiled milk, and four table-spoonfuls
of sugar. This was poured into the cylinder
and frozen. Molly had ordered half a pint of cream to
be kept for her the day before, so that she would be sure
of having it from twenty-four to thirty-six hours old,
and the other gill was left in the ice till it was thoroughly
chilled. Buying cream in such small quantity she could
not afford to have the usual milky residuum, and knew
the only way to whip it <i>solid</i> without one tea-spoonful of
waste, was to have it <i>at least twenty-four hours old</i>, and
<i>thoroughly chilled</i>, then to beat it steadily, without
taking the beater out till it was as solid as the white of
egg. This usually happens in ten minutes with a pint
of cream, but if the kitchen is warm and it does not
“come” in that time, it is often an economy of time to
set it in the ice, just as it is, to get chilled again; there is
no occasion to remove the froth as it rises,—the whip
will be finer and firmer without.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta made the Madeleine cake, while Molly stood
by, recipe in hand.</p>

<p>“This cake, Marta, has no milk, and therefore requires
no baking-powder; neither queen cake, sponge
cake, pound cake, in fact none of the finer cakes have
milk, and they are raised entirely with eggs. But
several very good imitations of these cakes are made
with baking-powder; the saving is not great, and a cake
made without chemicals keeps fresh much longer.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madeleine Cake.</span>—For Madeleine cake you must
weigh four ounces of butter, half a pound of sugar, half
a pound of flour twice sifted; then grate the rind of half
a lemon into the sugar, separate the yolks from the whites
of three large or four small eggs, put two table-spoonfuls
of wine in this cup, and, before you begin to make the
cake, butter a small cake-pan. Now beat the whites of
the eggs till you can turn the bowl without their slipping,
cream the butter well, then beat the yolks of eggs into
it, then add the sugar and wine; beat <i>well</i> again, and
then add flour and whites of eggs alternately, and when
all is well mixed, pour it into the pan, and bake it in a
rather slow oven for an hour.</p>

<p>“I am having only half the recipe made, so the cake is
not very large; but we are such small cake-eaters that we
get tired of a large one. Another time, if you make this
cake, you may put rose-water or peach-water instead of the
wine, and chopped candied lemon-peel instead of the grated
peel. You see the batter is much thicker than for the cup
cake you made, but if at any time you use flour that absorbs
more moisture, you must add another egg; this is,
as it should be, as thick as pound-cake batter,—which
means, as thick as can be stirred. It is more a paste than
a batter. Will you remember that, when you have a
recipe which says ‘thick as pound-cake batter’? Any
cake with baking-powder made as thick as this would be
spoiled. It would be tough, with great holes here and
there, so you must be very careful not to confuse the two
rules,—<i>moderately thick</i> batter for plain cakes, with
milk and baking-powder; very thick batter for the richer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
ones, made without. Yet, of course, they must be stirred
with a spoon; if too stiff for that, your flour is very absorbent,
and you need another egg. Remember there is
<i>never</i> any harm in adding an egg; it will never spoil your
cake as too much milk would do.</p>

<p>“All cakes without baking-powder or its equivalents,
soda and cream of tartar, require a much slower oven
than those with them. A slow oven ruins a plain cake, a
quick one spoils a rich cake, and you must be especially
careful to turn it very gently, and, in taking this or <i>any</i>
cake with much butter in it from the oven, to put it on
the table very gently. I have known a cake to come
from the oven perfect, yet, from being dropped hastily
on the table, to collapse with a puff of steam issuing
from it. The same thing may happen from taking it
from the pan while quite hot, or from its not being quite
cooked through; cakes require to ‘soak’ a few minutes
even after a broom straw comes out clean. Lack of
knowledge on these small points is one of the reasons
why many people who make excellent plain cakes—by
which I mean all the variety of cakes with baking-powder
and little butter—do not succeed with richer
ones, and why so many look upon pound cake as so very
difficult, while it is really as easy as any other.”</p>

<p>Marta had twice succeeded admirably with the cup
cake, which her unfortunate bang of the oven door had
spoiled the first time.</p>

<p>Instead of frying the <i>filet de sole</i> for dinner, Molly intended
to have what is called by cooks <i>turbans of sole</i>,
with béchamel. She put the bones and fins left from
boning a flounder (see directions, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX</a>.) into a
pint of water, and let them stew slowly at the back of
the range; then she rolled up the filets and fastened
each with a wooden toothpick, and set them to keep cool
until she was ready to cook them.</p>

<p>For the miroton of beef she cut from the braised beef
of the night before some very delicate slices and laid
them in an oval dish; then she put a large table-spoonful
of butter in a small saucepan, and let it get very hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and poured into it a cup of rice, which had been boiled
till just dry and tender, but not broken; this was fried,
with frequent stirring, till pale brown, when it was
poured over the beef, making a cover. The cold gravy,
which was a solid jelly and rather too highly flavored for
the purpose, was diluted with an equal quantity of hot
water and a pinch of salt; a tea-spoonful of brown thickening
was stirred into it, and enough poured over the
rice to moisten the whole, but not make it “sloppy;”
the dish was then put into the oven to remain for half
an hour.</p>

<p>Marta had put on the potatoes early, and when they
were boiled she mashed them (keeping them quite hot)
with a fork, beating it rapidly back and forth till they
were white and light; then Molly took them herself,
and told her to strain the bones from the fish broth or
stock, to put a salt-spoonful of salt in it, and set it to boil
again; then to chop some parsley <i>very fine</i>, to cut a thin
slice of blood-red pickled beet, and cut from it with a
thimble (in the absence of the proper tube) little disks
the size of a dime.</p>

<p>Molly seasoned the potatoes highly, putting to them
(there was a scant pint) a dessert-spoonful of butter, salt,
pepper, a grate of nutmeg, and a little parsley. Then
she beat an egg and added part of it, keeping out only
enough to brush over the balls when made. She formed
each about the size of a small orange, and brushed them
over with the egg. They were placed on a buttered tin
and put in the oven to brown.</p>

<p>The turbans of fish were now put in the boiling stock,
and boiled till they were milky-white instead of clear—about
eight minutes; then Molly took them up with a
skimmer, and in a small saucepan stirred a dessert-spoonful
of butter and one of flour together, letting them bubble
a few seconds, and then poured a gill of the fish stock
and half one of milk to it, stirring all the time (in fact,
making white sauce, but using part fish stock instead of
all milk, which makes béchamel for fish; made with
veal or chicken stock it is béchamel for meat). When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
seasoned with a little pepper, the little rolled filets were
placed standing up in a small dish, and the sauce poured
all over them to mask them entirely; then Molly took
a little parsley on the end of a knife and carefully
sprinkled it over the same, which, being thick, allowed
it to rest upon it; then a disk of the blood-red beet was
laid deftly on the top of each turban, and a very pretty
dish was the result.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I leave you to bring the dinner in as
soon as Mr. Bishop is ready. I have left the iced coffee
packed ready; all you have to do is to wipe every spot
of ice and salt from the outside, and then fill two cups
from it. Pile each cup very high with the whipped
cream, and bring in the cake at the same time.”</p>

<small>FRICASSEED CHICKEN—LEMON HONEY—FRENCH
ICING TO KEEP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Molly, while showing Marta how to
cook the dinner, added two other articles to those she
liked to have always ready. Cake, as she said, was so
little eaten by Harry and herself that a loaf lasted a
week, even with Marta’s help, for she, like most of her
countrywomen, lived largely on soups, and salad, and
vegetables, and cared little for sweets. She did not care
to have the same cake, over and over again, and had she
had preserves in the house, would have found it easy
to convert it into something more attractive. Had she
been keeping house long enough, jams and jellies would
have been in her store-room; peaches were now the
only available fruit, and by the time Molly was settled
enough to think of doing them up, they were both poor
and dear, and in the boarding-house they had been rather
surfeited with canned peaches, therefore she had let them
go. She had lately been unearthing several old recipes
of her mother’s and grandmother’s, and some of them
she meant to try. There was one called “lemon honey.”
It was of more modern date than the others, and as her
mother had written under it “nice change from preserves
for cake,” she decided to make it. She required for it
half a pound of sugar, the rind and juice of a large fresh
lemon, the yolks of three eggs and white of one, and
three ounces of sweet butter.</p>

<p>She followed directions, which were to put the butter
and sugar together in a saucepan. (As the butter was
rather salt she took the precaution of washing it first.)
While these melted, she beat the eggs thoroughly, grated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
off the lemon peel into them, taking care to remove all
the yellow, which contains the flavor of lemon, yet not to
grate deeply enough to remove any of the white, pithy
rind, and then mixed all together over the fire until as
thick as honey, taking care it did not scorch. When
done it was thick, smooth, yellow, and semi-opaque.
She poured it into two small jelly-glasses, and put it
away.</p>

<p>While she was doing this, Marta had been picking
over a scant half pint of black beans for soup, which
when washed she put over the fire in a quart of cold
water, in which she also put one small onion, two cloves,
a tiny pinch of marjoram, one slightly larger of thyme,
and two sprigs of parsley. These were to simmer slowly,
until the beans could be rubbed through a strainer, and
then a pint of strong beef stock, which had been making
all morning, was to be added, and all boiled together for
an hour.</p>

<p>When the soup was on, Marta prepared a fowl as
Molly had shown her, and when it was done she directed
her how to cut it into neat joints for fricassee, without
mangling it. While Marta was doing this Molly put a
pound of sugar and a small cup of water into a small
iron saucepan that she assured herself was beautifully
clean, and set it over the fire. While the syrup came to
the boiling-point she turned her attention to the fricassee,
and told Marta to lay the pieces in a saucepan with
boiling water to just cover them, to cut an onion and
half a medium carrot and put it to them, with a level
tea-spoonful of salt and the sixth of one of pepper.
These were to simmer very slowly until the fowl was
tender,—about two hours,—then the fowl to be taken
up, the gravy strained and put to boil very fast, till
there was less than half a pint, while in another saucepan,
half a pint of thick, white sauce was made (a good
table-spoonful of butter and a full one of flour to half a
pint of milk). This was added to the chicken gravy;
they were stirred smooth together, and the chicken returned
to it and allowed to simmer in it a few minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>When Molly had seen the fricassee prepared and
slowly stewing, she turned to the sugar, which was now
boiling fast. She removed a little bluish scum, very
carefully, not to stir the syrup. When it had boiled a
quarter of an hour, she began to try it, dipping the fork
into it, and when all the drops had run off, watching if
a long thread remained. At first the drops ran off
quickly, and she waited a minute before trying again,
when she dipped in the fork. Drops came now slow
and thick, and after the last one a short thick end remained,
and she knew the point had nearly come. The
next dip left a long, floating hair, and Molly took it from
the fire and put it to get cool while she prepared the
pudding, for which she used the following recipe: Two
apples, finely chopped, two ounces of grated bread, two
of sugar, two of currants, two eggs and the rind of a
lemon, grated with just enough of the juice to give a
perceptible acid, about a third of a pinch of salt, and
the third of a small nutmeg, grated. Stir all together
and pour into a small, buttered bowl that it will just fill.</p>

<p>Molly followed the recipe, tied a cloth over the top
(see directions for boiled puddings, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>.) and
put it into fast-boiling water to boil continually an hour
and a half.</p>

<p>Lemon sauce was prescribed for this pudding, but as
she had used eggs freely lately and it required two, she
substituted hard sauce.</p>

<p>The boiled sugar was now about blood-warm, and a
thin crust like ice had formed over it. This she was
vexed to see, but she picked it off. Underneath, it was
as thick as very thick molasses. She stirred it with a
spoon, which was rather hard work, and in about five
minutes it began to look milky; this by continual beating
changed to a texture like lard. Now she could use
the spoon no longer, and worked it like dough in her
hands. When it was a compact, smooth mass she pressed
it into a tumbler and covered it with oiled paper.</p>

<p>Marta had been looking on with wondering eyes to
see simple sugar change from a crystal-clear syrup to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cream, and then to a paste, and now asked what it
was for.</p>

<p>“That is for icing cakes, and as it will keep just so
for months, it is always ready. I should have called
your attention to the boiling, only there was too much
on hand, and there are such delicate degrees in boiling
sugar that you would need your whole attention; some
time you may take sugar and experiment; there can be
no waste—unless you burn it, but that will not be
likely—for it can be boiled over and over again.
When it is <i>perfectly</i> boiled, that thin crust is not upon
it, only a jelly-like skin; but when it does form, if you
find it is only on the surface, you can take it off and
keep it to sweeten other things, but should it be <i>grainy</i>
all through, you must put water to it again, and boil it
back to the ‘thread’; on the other hand, if you take it
from the fire an instant too soon, you will find that, instead
of forming a paste that you can handle, it will remain
thick cream. This would do for icing, as the cake
absorbs some of the moisture, but it would not do to
keep, nor could you add much flavoring or coloring, so
it is always better to boil it to a higher degree. To-morrow
I’ll show you how it is to be used. Now I
think you understand the principle of frying well enough
to make the potato croquettes if I read the recipe to
you. This is it: Two cups of potato, mashed very
smooth without milk, a dessert-spoonful of butter, salt to
taste, a pinch of white pepper and a very little nutmeg
(rub the nutmeg across the grater twice), and the yolk
of an egg. Mix all together; and for economy’s sake I
am going to use only the white of the egg for crumbing;
beat it with two tea-spoonfuls of water. Make
the potatoes into the shape of small pears, roll each in
the white of egg, then into cracker meal, and fry just as
you do the other croquettes, in very hot fat. When they
are done, stick the end of a sprig of parsley into the
end of each one to simulate the stalk.”</p>

<small>BOILED CUSTARD—FROZEN BANANAS—USES OF
FRENCH ICING—SCALLOPED POTATOES—HOLLANDAISE
SAUCE—ROAST OYSTERS—UNEXPECTED
VISITORS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> next day’s dinner Molly bought a piece of cod
about three inches thick, and a leg of mutton (the cod
weighed three pounds, the mutton six and a half, which
she directed the butcher to cut in half), and half a dozen
bananas.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached home she made a boiled custard
with two eggs and a pint of milk, in the following
way: The eggs were whipped while the milk came near
to the boiling-point. When that was reached, two heaped
table-spoonfuls of sugar were added to the milk, and
when dissolved it was poured to the eggs, stirring all the
time. Both were then returned to the saucepan—which
was set over the fire in a vessel or saucepan containing
boiling water—and stirred. When the water in the under
saucepan boiled round it, the custard was removed a few
seconds, the stirring continuing all the time, and then it
was returned. This was repeated till it was like thick
cream. The object of removing it was this: The eggs
must not boil or they will curdle; they must be <i>cooked</i>
or they will not thicken; if left in the boiling water
they would boil; by removing every minute for a few
seconds, you keep the custard at the boiling-point till it
thickens, without running risk of its curdling. Frequently,
in the fear of custard’s curdling, it is taken off
the fire just at the boiling-point, and it remains thin,
unless corn-starch has been first boiled with the milk;
in the proportion of two eggs to the pint, corn-starch is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
not needed for moderately thick custards. When it was
done it was set to get cold, and two bananas were cut
into small pieces. While the cooking was going on,
Molly got out the Madeleine cake, cut side slices from it
the third of an inch thick, cut the dark crust off as thin
as possible, and spread three of the slices with the lemon
paste she had made yesterday. The other three she
laid on these, sandwich-fashion.</p>

<p>“Now, Marta, I’ll show you what I am going to do
with my <i>fondant</i> icing.” As she spoke she put a table-spoonful
of it in a cup which she set in boiling water
over the fire. “You see I stir this, because, if I simply
left it to melt, it would go back to clear syrup; by stirring,
it keeps opaque like cream. I do not let this get
too hot, only just warm enough to run easily.” When
it had reached the point of being like <i>double cream</i> or
molasses, she put the saucepan and cup on the table and
added to it a few drops of vanilla and stirred it; then
with a tea-spoon she iced each slice, pouring the <i>fondant</i>
on and spreading it, allowing it to run over the sides.</p>

<p>“You see this icing cools as you do it, and it may
happen in cold weather that it will cool before you finish
(and if the candy has been boiled rather high, the
same thing may happen any time); then you must dip
a knife in boiling water, shake off the drops quickly and
smooth with that; then you use the knife. Now if I had
cochineal in the house I should have melted only half
the quantity in this cup and half in another, and flavored
one with rose, and added a very little coloring,—three
or four drops,—and used it for half of these cakes; but
as it is, I leave them all white.”</p>

<p>Molly worked as she spoke; the three slices were
iced, then she held a sharp knife on the range till it was
quite warm, wiped it, and cut the cake into neat tablets
an inch wide and the width of the cake,—about two
inches. Each slice made four, so she had a dozen small
fancy cakes.</p>

<p>“You can see, Marta, how easy it is, if your icing is
always ready and you have preserves, to have a plate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
very pretty cakes in a few minutes. You may make a
dozen and a half, or more; then half a dozen may be
white with lemon between; half a dozen with red currant
jelly, and icing colored with a small piece of unsweetened
chocolate melted in a saucer on the stove and
then stirred to the icing; and the others with peach, and
pink icing flavored very slightly with bitter almond; and
for very ornamental purposes, a dozen almonds, blanched
and chopped to size of rice and sprinkled over the pink
and white while the icing is still warm, make a very
pretty change; in fact, very many varieties can be made
once you have got the idea, and remember never to
mix flavors badly. Vanilla and chocolate always agree;
so you can use the same icing for the white and chocolate
by doing the white cakes first, then putting the
melted chocolate—and just a drop or two of water
from the end of your finger or a spoon—to it. Chocolate
stiffens so much that you are more likely than not
to require a knife dipped in boiling water to spread it.
When all are done you may mix your pink and chocolate
candy together, if the flavors agree (vanilla and
chocolate and rose go exceedingly well, but almond or
lemon not), work it together with hand or spoon, and
the result will be a lovely ashes-of-roses color. You
may put it away so flavored and colored for future use,
or you may use it at once for other cake, which is better,
as color fades if kept too long; but remember one thing:
this icing, having been made hot, will be stiffer than when
you began, and to be melted over again will need perhaps
a dozen drops of water mixed with it; if it has
become sugary and rough, you can’t use it; but if on taking
a pinch between your finger and thumb it will spread
smoothly like putty or dough, it is as good as ever, which
it is almost certain to be if you have worked quickly.</p>

<p>“The only art in this French icing is to have everything
ready before you begin coloring and flavoring, to
have almonds, if you use them, blanched and chopped,—in
short, have to leave off for nothing; then you can
work quickly, and the icing is not allowed to cool, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
will not need reheating once or twice before you have
finished. At first such quickness may not be easy, and
if the icing chills, you will find it unmanageable; all
you have to do is to return it in the water to the fire,
and melt as at first; it will usually stand melting two or
three times before getting grainy. Stir, while melting,
only enough to mix the melted and unmelted together.
Of course it is always easier to melt a quantity of icing
in a bowl, and do a number of cakes, than a table-spoonful
as I have done, because it holds the heat better, and
you have abundance to work from; but I don’t want to
destroy the delicacy of what I put away by melting all
up. You see I have a little ball left.”</p>

<p>She had gathered the icing from the cups and spoon
and worked it between her hands into a little shining
ball, simply to show Marta what could be done if more
had been left. “This is not worth putting away, but
several little marbles like these if dipped into melted
chocolate would make chocolate creams. You see how
one thing leads to another in cooking.”</p>

<p>The custard was now cold, the bananas were stirred
into it and they were put into the freezer, and ice and
salt in the proportion of one third salt were packed
round it. After it had stood a few minutes, Marta
turned it for a quarter of an hour, when it was frozen.</p>

<p>Just as Molly was about to begin to write directions
for the scalloped potatoes, concluding she herself would
need to make only the Hollandaise sauce, and could
leave the dinner to Marta, a hack drove up to the door,
and Molly saw Harry’s mother and father in it.</p>

<p>To say she did not tremble would not be correct; for
an instant her heart sank; if she had only known
they were coming! She wondered if everything was as
nice as she would wish it in the little sitting-room. She
generally had it, not trim, or oppressively tidy, but with
only the pleasant disorder of a room that is lived in;
but Marta had a way sometimes of leaving her brush or
dustpan—sometimes a kitchen cloth—where it ought
not to be. Molly looked at herself, but she was neat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and no one had a right to expect a housewife at eleven
in the morning to be ready for company. While Marta
went to the door she removed her apron and washed
her hands, and when she reëntered the kitchen just
waited to say:—</p>

<p>“Marta, make some of your nice noodles at once;
leave your up-stairs sweeping till later, and I’ll let you
know what to get for lunch.” She passed into the parlor,
having in the short interval recovered her composure,
and welcomed her unexpected visitors as if their coming
were a pleasant surprise, and not an embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Will you come up-stairs and take off your things?”
asked Molly, thankful that in consequence of her wanting
to show Marta how to make custard and use French
icing, the sweeping was not begun and the whole place
topsy-turvy and draped in sweeping-sheets.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about staying; we just thought
we would run out and see what sort of a place you had
here, and take the next train back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you would not do that?” cried Molly, all her
hospitable instincts revolting. “What would Harry
say? You must stay till he comes home, and he can
perhaps induce you to stay all night.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no—no, thank you; Mr. Bishop rarely
stays anywhere from home at night.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear,” echoed her father-in-law, “I am
as old-fogyish as a bachelor, and I like to be at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least you must stay the day.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we shall not put you out, we will remain
an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“Come up-stairs, then; you will rest better when
your cloak is off.”</p>

<p>Molly had never felt as if her house was a bandbox
till now. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop seemed literally to fill
the parlor, yet they were not very large. Harry was
much taller than his father, but they both had a ponderous
way with them. Mrs. Bishop’s voice, too, was a
deep contralto, which she used in a manner which, had
it been affected, would have been haughty, but, natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as it had become, yet seemed to impress people against
their will with a sense of her importance.</p>

<p>“And so this is your little cottage? Do you find
room in it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Molly, smiling, “plenty;” but as she
followed her mother-in-law up the narrow stairs, which
had never seemed so narrow till she saw the rich dress
and velvet-clad shoulders fill the whole space, she could
see how very tiny it might seem to one accustomed to
large rooms and broad spaces.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop glanced around the pretty bed-room.</p>

<p>“And Harry and you really are contented here?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed, we are more than contented; I’m as happy
as the day is long.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very strange for Harry; he was always
the most fastidious boy; but happiness is everything, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“We think so.”</p>

<p>Molly helped Mrs. Bishop off with her cloak, which
was so handsome as to look strangely out of place in
that simple cottage room, and then said, “If you will excuse
me, I will send you up some hot water and give
orders for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you; don’t let me keep you; and
please don’t make any preparation.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not; I must only see that sufficient for
three persons instead of one is on the table.”</p>

<p>She ran down-stairs, took Marta’s rolling-pin out of
her hand, told her to take a pitcher of water up-stairs,
and rolled the noodle-paste till she returned.</p>

<p>“Marta, directly your noodles are made, go to Mrs.
Framley’s and ask her to please telephone to the fishmonger
for a quarter of a hundred oysters in the deep
shell, to be sent here for one o’clock. Be as quick as
you can, and when you come back you will find on the
dining-room table full written instructions for what you
are to do.”</p>

<p>Molly went to the parlor and found Mr. Bishop reading
his paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on reading for a minute, please; I will write a
line. I know if you have not got through the morning
news you will be glad to do it.”</p>

<p>“I just glanced at the money market at breakfast,
and I’ve too much respect for my eyes to read in the
cars.”</p>

<p>Molly went to the davenport and wrote Marta’s instructions.
Her first impulse had been to use her materials
for dinner, to have the frozen bananas for dessert;
but on second thought she resolved to give just what she
meant to have for her own lunch, with oysters to make
enough; the bread was fresh and very good; therefore
she wrote the following:—</p>

<p>“Make the cold bean soup boiling hot, boil one egg
hard and cut it in quarters lengthwise, then across; lay
it in the soup-tureen and pour the soup on it. Cut four
thin slices of lemon and drop them in as it comes to
table. When the oysters come, set them, in their shells,
in a dripping-pan; put on each a bit of butter, size of a
hazel-nut; pepper them and set them over the fire till
the liquor in the shells bubbles; watch till the butter
melts, then they are done; take them off the fire immediately.
Use a cloth to put them on a hot dish; take
care you do not spill the gravy. Serve with hot plates.</p>

<p>“Cut the cold pudding in finger-lengths, make a batter
of two table-spoonfuls of flour, a pinch of salt, and milk
to make it as thick as thick cream; dip each piece into
the batter, and fry in deep fat till brown; sift sugar
over it, and serve with hard sauce.”</p>

<p>As Molly wrote the last words she heard Mrs. Bishop
coming down-stairs, and wondered much what she could
do to entertain her. She had actually never been with
her without Harry before, but the matter solved itself,
for the elder lady questioned her as to her mode of life,
what she did with her time, how Harry and she spent
the evenings, and when told as simply as Molly knew
how, she laughed, with a sort of good-natured sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Quite idyllic, I declare; so Harry reads aloud while
you sew,—or else you both play chess.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; of course we are almost strangers in Greenfield.
When we are better known no doubt we may go
out more, but all our neighbors are very pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Now that is one thing I wanted to caution you
about; one of the penalties of living in a place like this
is that you must know every one, and are apt to make
intimates that you can not shake off easily when you go
away.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Molly, with some dignity, “I shall make
no intimacies I should ever want to shake off; people
good enough to be my friends now will be good enough
at all times.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I think when I was your age I had just
such ideas, but I found as I grew older I had to do as
others do.”</p>

<p>The time did not pass very gayly, and Molly wondered
how she would get through the afternoon if they
should stay, for she believed that she and her mother-in-law
had nothing in common.</p>

<p>When the time came, Molly excused herself and
went in to help Marta lay the cloth. The silver and
glass were always bright, so there was no hasty rubbing
and polishing at the last minute. That morning Harry
had brought in from the tiny flower-bed a handful of
geranium and coleus, saying: “We have to take them
as they are ready; frost may come at any time now.”</p>

<p>And they were now ready for the centre, arranged in
a deep glass dish, the rich coleus round the edge, the
geraniums in the middle. They gave the little table an
air of brightness that nothing but flowers could have
done.</p>

<p>Molly did not want to be many minutes from the
parlor, as she knew Mrs. Bishop would think great preparations
were being made, and she would rather have
given them bread and cheese than that, but she thought
she would trust Marta to follow her written directions,
as the only things, except the oysters, to cook were those
she was very familiar with. The result justified her.
It is true the soup had the eggs cut in slices instead of
as directed, but that mattered little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were seated and Mr. Bishop, who was a
<i>gourmet</i> if not a <i>gourmand</i>, exclaimed: “Capital soup!
capital! why don’t we have it at home?”—Molly felt
a good deal relieved and a little triumphant, for Mrs.
Bishop was very proud of her cook.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear George! I did not know you cared
for bean soup!”</p>

<p>“I don’t, unless it’s first rate.”</p>

<p>When soup was removed and Marta entered with the
large dish of oysters, Molly gave one hasty glance,—would
they be shriveled into leather, or flabby and half
cooked? But the error had been on the best side; more
than half were perfectly cooked, the others barely hot
through. Poor Marta had followed instructions, but
had not thought to turn the pan. However, Molly was
only too thankful to have so little wrong, and helped the
best to her visitors. They were still almost boiling in
the shell; and after this came a pretty dish of noodles
that Marta had arranged round a mound of grated
cheese.</p>

<p>After the luncheon Mrs. Bishop said with a tone of approval
which Molly was determined not to think patronizing,
“I declare, Molly, you keep house very nicely.”</p>

<p>“You must have a remarkable good cook, by Jove!”
broke in Mr. Bishop.</p>

<p>“I am glad you think so,” said Molly, smiling.</p>

<p>“Where did you get her?”</p>

<p>“Castle Garden.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop almost screamed when she heard it, and
then Molly found the right conversational key was
struck, for her mother-in-law had a great deal to say
about her own troubles with servants, and the troubles
of her friends; and when the “hour of digestion” had
passed, she asked if they would like to go out and see
some of the beauties of Greenfield.</p>

<p>“Well, that depends on what train we take.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you would stay and see Harry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop looked inquiringly at her husband, who
said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we must stay and see Harry, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Molly smiled inwardly, as she thought that his luncheon
had reassured him as to his dinner. They all
went out for an hour; there was not much to see but
some pretty, well-kept Queen Anne houses, and Mrs.
Bishop let drop the remark that she had little expected
ever to see a son of hers living in the second-rate neighborhood
of a country town, which remark Molly prudently
ignored.</p>

<p>When they returned to the house, Mrs. Bishop, at
Molly’s suggestion, went to lie down, and her husband
stretched himself on the sofa, and Molly slipped from
the room, for she could see he too was drowsy. She
went to the kitchen, told Marta how well she thought
she had managed the lunch, and then gave directions for
the dinner in writing, for she wanted to attend to her
guests as much as possible. What she wrote was as
follows:</p>

<p>“At five o’clock, put the mutton in the oven as usual,
and the fish into salt and water. At a quarter past, put
white onions on to boil in boiling water; and potatoes.
When the potatoes are just done, cut them in slices
thick as a dollar. Have ready a pint of white sauce,
remembering to use <i>two</i> table-spoonfuls of flour and <i>two</i>
of butter to the pint of milk. Chop a dessert-spoonful
of parsley very fine, lay the potatoes in a dish, sprinkle
a little parsley, pepper and salt among them, pour white
sauce over them enough to moisten without making
them sloppy, and strew grated bread crumbs over all; put
them in the oven to brown. Keep the rest of the white
sauce for the onions, which must be boiled very tender,
poured dry immediately after they are done, and then put
into the white sauce, and allowed to stew a few minutes.</p>

<p>“As soon as you have the potatoes ready for the oven,
put the fish, which you have nicely wiped, on a plate,
lay that on a napkin and set both in a saucepan of boiling
water, with two tea-spoonfuls of salt and two of vinegar.
It will take twenty minutes to boil.”</p>

<p>Molly had told Marta to take the peg out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
freezer and let off the water, at luncheon. She now
went to see if the frozen banana custard was in good
condition, and found it all right; then she took out the
paddle, worked the custard down from the sides, and
covered it, packing in more salt and ice.</p>

<p>“How glad I am we happened to have cold dessert,”
she thought; “it will save Marta so much at the last
moment.”</p>

<p>She read over the written instructions, although there
was nothing new but the manner of cooking the potatoes,
assured herself Marta understood everything, and
told her she would come out herself and make the fish
sauce.</p>

<p>It was after four o’clock, and she laid the table just as
she wanted it, went up-stairs and put on one of her prettiest
dresses, and then returned to the parlor. Mrs.
Bishop was just rousing as she passed her door, but did
not descend for some few minutes, which Molly took to
glance over the paper.</p>

<p>All the time she was talking with his mother and
father, Molly pictured Harry’s surprise at finding them,
and knew it would also be a pleasure. She did not
know what to augur from this visit, whether it was simply
curiosity, or meant any return of the old parental
tenderness for him; Harry would know, for he knew
their ways better than she did.</p>

<p>At last she heard his steps on the plank walk; she
flew to the door.</p>

<p>“What’s up, little woman? you look like an exclamation
point in person.”</p>

<p>The next moment he caught sight of his visitors.</p>

<p>“Mother! father! why, this is a good surprise.”</p>

<p>Molly slipped out of the room while Harry was hearing
all about their arrival, whipped on her apron and
made the Hollandaise sauce. She put into a little iron
saucepan a large table-spoonful of butter, a dessert-spoonful
of flour, and let them cook one minute; then she
poured to them two thirds of half a pint of boiling water,
stirred till smooth, then added, gradually, the yolks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
three beaten eggs; when she put the eggs in she stood
the saucepan in another of boiling water, and stirred it
well; after the eggs had thickened she put two tea-spoonfuls
of lemon juice, salt, and as much cayenne as would
go on the end of a penknife, and it was done. Marta
had taken up the fish, and Molly directed the sauce to
be poured entirely over it, herself seeing that there was
not a drop of water from the fish in the dish. A sprig
or two of parsley was laid at each end of the dish, and
lemon in slices round it; then casting her eye round to
see that Marta had everything ready but the meat, she
told her to bring the fish in when she should hear Mr.
Bishop come down.</p>

<p>The dinner was very nice, although, as Molly was
glad to think, simpler than they often had when alone,
and it was eaten without comment until the ice came on,
when Mrs. Bishop expressed surprise at their getting
such things in the country.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can, I believe, get excellent ice-creams here,
but this is home-made.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Bishop declared they must catch the
eight o’clock train. Harry urged them in vain to stay,
and then it was decided that Molly and Harry would go
to the depot with them.</p>

<p>As they parted Mrs. Bishop said: “Harry, you and
Molly must come home to spend Christmas, and had
better spend a week with us.”</p>

<p>Harry promised to do so if they could.</p>

<p>“Why, of course you can;—why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed Harry, “we are family people now,
with the responsibility of a house on our shoulders.”</p>

<p>“A house! a match-box, you mean.”</p>

<p>With this shot they parted. Harry’s real hesitation
was doubt as to what Molly might feel inclined to do;
there was no denying she had been badly treated,
snubbed and looked down upon.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t the strangest turn; I don’t think
I ever knew my father to leave business for a day before.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does it mean, Harry?” Molly asked anxiously,
for it had been a grief to her to feel she was the
cause of estrangement.</p>

<p>“It must mean that my father, or mother, or both,
are beginning to see they’ve been in fault.”</p>

<p>“Oh Harry, I should be so glad if you were once
more all you used to be—to them.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be that, for I shall never go back to
the sort of semi-dependence I was in,—but shall we
go at Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid <i>you</i> may not have a very good time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I shall.”</p>

<p>“Then we accept. I tell you what, little Molly, if
my father and mother had not been favorably impressed,—had
they found us living as they expected,
they would not have said a word about our going
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh Harry, I hope so; surely, the less comfortable
you were the more you would need them.”</p>

<p>“No, they look on it this way: as I made my bed so
I must lie on it. Had the bed been a bad one, they
would have said, ‘serve him right;’ as it seems much
better than they thought it would be, they are inclined
to think themselves wrong.”</p>

<p>Harry loved his parents, but he knew their pride, and
that they would not have openly forgiven the blow to it;
but he knew, small as the house was, Molly had shown
them as refined a home as their own, and they saw that,
after all, their daughter-in-law would grace any station
Harry might ever attain to.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>HOMINY MUFFINS—FISH BALLS—ROYAL CUSTARD—“CONSOMMÉ
À LA ROYALE”—FRICASSEE
SWEETBREADS—VANILLA SOUFFLÉ.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, bright and early, Molly came
down-stairs. She was going to help get breakfast, as
she always did whenever she had any dish new to
Marta. Two or three times a week the breakfast came
out of the dinner of the day before, and the stock she
generally had on hand made such warmed-over dishes
very different from the flavorless ones they too often
are. For this reason alone she would have considered
it cheap to buy a small soup-bone once a week, even if
she had needed no soup, but every little drop—even half
a gill—of soup that might be left was saved, and here
Marta’s German training came in. Whatever she lacked
in other ways, she had none of the disdain of economy,
confounding it with stinginess, so common with untrained
servants. Every bit of fat was put aside to try
out once a week, every tea-spoonful of gravy or soup
saved, and all bones put in one crock to be twice a week
boiled down.</p>

<p>When there was not likely to be much left from dinner,
Molly fell back on kidneys or ham and eggs for
breakfast; once a week there was always fish in some
form. This morning there was a little mutton on the
bone, just enough for mince or fritters; there was, also,
quite a piece of fish. She had bought it with that calculation,
so the mutton was left for another day. Harry
did not like codfish balls of salt cod, but delighted in
them from fresh, and, as once boiled, it would keep a
week, she had intended to have them twice. Her visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
however, had changed that programme, but she had
more than enough for breakfast. As she herself was in
the kitchen, too, she decided to make hominy muffins,
there being a cup of cold hominy.</p>

<p>As the frying fat would take half an hour to get hot
enough, Marta had been told to put it on the range (covered
to keep in the fumes) soon after the fire should
be lighted. Molly drew it forward that it might be
ready by the time she herself was so. She set Marta to
mash the hominy fine with a fork, then to add to one
cup of it a cup of corn meal, half a cup of milk, and
two tea-spoonfuls of melted butter, two tea-spoonfuls of
sugar, one egg, and one tea-spoonful of baking-powder,
and when beaten long and hard, to put it into gempans
and bake fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>While Marta was doing this, she herself flaked the
cold fish quite fine and called Marta’s attention to the
fact that she used the remaining sauce to moisten it.</p>

<p>“If I had not this sauce, I should make just enough
stiff white sauce to moisten the whole; but this is even
better, and as there is egg in it I need use only one
more.”</p>

<p>To a cup of flaked fish and sauce, of which there were
two good table-spoonfuls, she put one beaten egg; this
made it into a stiff batter or mush that would not <i>run</i>,
but <i>drop</i> from a spoon. She seasoned it with pepper, a
very little salt, and then dipping a table-spoon in flour,
dropped large spoonfuls of it in the fat, which was hot
enough for croquettes. In two minutes they were round
and light as puffs, and beautifully brown. Knowing
Marta might have to make them some time without
having any sauce, Molly wrote the recipe and gave it to
her.</p>

<p>One cup of flaked fish, one table-spoonful of butter,
one small one of flour, and one <i>gill</i> of milk; melt butter
and flour together, let them cook a few seconds, pour to
them a gill of boiling milk, stir well over the fire till the
mixture leaves the sides of the saucepan; then it is done.
Mix the fish with it, add two well-beaten eggs, and fry
in spoonfuls in boiling lard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry called these glorified fish balls. “In fact,
Molly, they deserve some much more high-toned
name.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but people who like the usual codfish balls,
and they are the large majority, would not like these.”</p>

<p>“Another reason for not calling them fish balls, but I
am one of the minority who do not like our Columbian
dainty in its orthodox form; but even minorities have
tastes and some right to have them considered. We’ll
dub these ‘minority fish balls’ if you will have no more
fanciful name.” (And “minority fish balls” they have
become in that family.)</p>

<p>For dinner there was to be clear soup with royal custard,
the stock for which had been made for bean soup,
and only a pint used. Molly usually made two quarts
at a time from a three-pound soup-bone, which served
twice for soup and left a pint for gravies, sauce, etc. A
pint and a half at each meal was ample, as neither
Harry or herself took half a pint, and half usually
found its way out to Marta, who straightway made it
thick with bread and any vegetables there were; she
did not approve of straining it.</p>

<p>To make a change, Molly intended to have in it royal
custard, which would make it <i>Consommé à la Royale</i>.</p>

<p>“Marta, we are coming to the end of our eggs. I
must have extra ones. Mrs. Lennox’s man comes to-day;
you run over and ask her to please send him to
me.”</p>

<p>When Marta returned she told her to beat one egg,
then mix it with <i>half a gill</i> of the cold stock, and, as
as there was no gill measure (something Molly had resolved
to get, but had forgotten, though she could have
better done without the half-pint), and the quantity
must be so exact, she measured half a pint of water, and
divided it in four, put the fourth part in a glass and
marked it, then threw out the water, and filled up to the
mark with stock. It made about <i>four table-spoonfuls</i>.
Molly looked about for something smaller than a cup,
and found a little Liebig’s “extract of meat” jar; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
she buttered. The beaten egg and half gill of soup,
with a pinch of salt, were mixed and poured into it,
then a piece of paper was tied over it, a small saucepan
of water put over the fire, and when it was quite boiling
the jar was placed in it, the water reaching to the height
of the custard, but without danger of boiling into it.
The saucepan was then drawn aside so that the water
might only <i>simmer;</i> if it should boil the custard would
be spoilt. It was left for twelve minutes, and when
taken out was quite firm. When cold the custard was
cut into diamonds.</p>

<p>“When you have the soup hot, to-night, throw these
diamonds into it, Marta.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose,” thought Molly, “any one ever
made quite so small a quantity of savory custard before,
yet more would be waste; we should not need
it.”</p>

<p>At market she found a fine pair of sweetbreads, one
of the dainties her butcher was not fashionable enough
to charge a fancy price for, and indeed she found
thirty cents a pair an outside price in Greenfield; these
were twenty-five, however, and had they been as small
as they sometimes are, she would not have bought them;
but they were large and white.</p>

<p>As soon as they came they were put into salt and
water and an hour later into boiling water, and parboiled
for fifteen minutes, and cold water poured over them.
All gristle and skin was now removed, and one cut into
small pieces.</p>

<p>An hour before dinner the remains of the fricasseed
fowl were brought out. Less than half had been eaten.
There remained a wing, part of the breast, a leg, and the
back and side bones. Molly cut the drumstick off, laid
it with the side bones for a grill for breakfast,—it
would help out the minced mutton; the rest, which were
nice joints, she laid, covered with sauce as they were, in
a plate, and told Marta to beat an egg, dip them in it,
taking care every part was covered; then to lay them
in abundance of cracker crumbs, pat them gently, and
fry them just like breaded chops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime she had gathered the sauce from the
chicken, which, by her direction, had been poured over
it when the dish was changed, and put it into a small
saucepan with a gill of stock, then the pieces of sweetbread,
and put the saucepan where it would simmer.
She then cut circles from slices of stale bread, half an
inch thick, each circle cut in half to form canapées; she
dipped each in milk, and then laid it in flour, covered it
well with flour, and left it so.</p>

<p>“Marta, when you fry the chicken, drop these pieces
of bread in the pot. Be sure to shake off all superfluous
flour; handle them gently for fear of breaking, and let
them fry pale brown. Be careful for the first minute
after they are in; they will sputter, as they are wet.
Lay them round the sweetbreads when you take them
up.”</p>

<p>Marta had already sliced some tomatoes; these were
laid in a dish, and bread crumbs, bits of butter, and
pepper and salt sprinkled over each layer, on the top
more crumbs and tiny bits of butter thickly strewed;
then the dish was put to bake for half an hour.</p>

<p>“Marta, a few minutes before taking up the sweetbreads,
stir into the gravy a small tea-spoonful of white
thickening. I see it will not be thick enough with the
fricassee sauce. Now you have potatoes on, tomatoes
in the oven, your frying-kettle back of the stove, soup
ready to heat up five minutes before dinner, chicken
ready crumbed, and I will make a vanilla soufflé.”</p>

<p>Gouffe’s recipe for vanilla soufflé was as follows,
Molly using only a third of the original, which calls for
a quart of milk:</p>

<p>“One third of a quart of milk (not quite three gills),
two table-spoonfuls of flour, two of sugar, a tea-spoonful
of vanilla extract, a pinch of salt. Mix the flour with
part of milk, set the rest to boil; when it boils, mix both
together as you would corn starch; if by chance it is not
smooth, strain it, return to fire, stirring well. Take it
off when it boils, put to it the yolks of two eggs, and
beat very well; then add the whites, <i>beaten till you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
turn the dish over without their slipping</i>. The whites
must be stirred in with greatest gentleness,—any quick
stirring will cause them to liquefy and spoil your soufflé;
when the whites are blended, bake in a buttered dish
twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>Molly prepared it and told Marta to put it in the oven
when she put the soup on to get hot, that they might
have about finished dinner when it was done; but it was
better for them to wait for the soufflé than the soufflé
for them, for waiting means spoiling it. Molly made
some hard sauce, which she flavored with wine, and then
left the dinner to Marta.</p>

<p>When Harry came home his face showed he had
something pleasant to say.</p>

<p>“Well, dear,” he said as soon as he was ready for
dinner, “you’ve done it, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Done what?” She would have been alarmed if
his face had not looked so very happy.</p>

<p>“You’ve captured my father.”</p>

<p>“Oh Harry, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He came into my office to-day, and told me he
had enjoyed himself out here very much, and he was
good enough to add that his opinion of me had not
changed in the least, that I had been as wrong-headed
as possible, and that if I had chanced to pick up a pearl
instead of a pebble, no thanks to my own wisdom. I
couldn’t agree, and told him I knew all along you were
a jewel, but he had the best of me, for he said,</p>

<p>“‘Rubbish, sir! You didn’t know that she could
boil an egg or sew a button on; no boy in love ever
asks that! and you might have been a pretty miserable
pair!’</p>

<p>“And it’s quite true, Molly. If you could not have
mended your own clothes, and I knew it, I should have
married you just the same; but I’m glad to have a
fortune <i>in</i> my wife, and so I told the dad.”</p>

<p>“Well, is that all he said?” asked Molly, her cheeks
flushed with pleasure, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no, he didn’t begin that way. He began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
by asking me how I expected to meet my quarter’s
bills. I told him there would be none. At first he
could not believe me, and I really believe he had come
to give me a check to get us out of the need he thought
we were likely to be in; but when I told him all, and
showed him your first month’s accounts—stop a minute”
(Molly made a dart forward to her desk)—“I abstracted
that first month’s figuring, my dear, and have it
in my pocket, and it will remain there; that is my property,
my trophy. Well, when I showed that, and told
him that I, with my little income, lived just as well as
he did, he was conquered.</p>

<p>“‘How does she do it?’ he asked; and then I had
to tell him that you put your time and thought to the
little money and doubled its value.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry, how could you exaggerate so?” But
Molly’s head was turned away and her eyes running
over with happy tears. How well was she repaid for
the work she had taken such pleasure in! Every tone
of her husband’s voice revealed his pride in her, and
his appreciation, veiled though it was by his gay, bantering
manners, and she was grateful for the training
that had made it all so easy to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>A SURPRISE—A BOILED DINNER—DRESDEN PATTIES—OYSTERS
AND BROWN BUTTER—“OLD ENGLISH”
FRITTERS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Molly returned from her walk to the dépôt
with Harry, she found on the back stoop a barrel and a
packing-case that had come by express. The barrel she
quickly saw contained apples; the packing-case was as
yet a mystery, but it did not long remain so. Molly was
not frightened at a hammer, and between her and Marta
the top was soon wrenched off; and then she saw it was
full of treasures. A dozen pots of raspberry jam, the
same of currant jelly, English pickled walnuts and
French canned peas and mushrooms, and boned chicken
enough to last her the winter, a jar of Canton ginger
and one of French plums, met Molly’s wondering eyes.
What luxuries for a young housekeeper! Of course
they could come only from Harry’s parents.</p>

<p>Had they sent her a present for herself she would have
resented it, considering how they had looked down on
her, but this gift she could take pleasure in, for it was as
much for Harry as for her, and only such things as
would be very pleasant and useful, but were not necessaries.
Her housewifely mind was already reveling in the
thought of a well stocked store-room.</p>

<p>She had found a letter from Mrs. Welles, at the post-office,
which she had waited to read till she could do so
at home and enjoy it, for her friend was a clever and
voluminous correspondent.</p>

<p>“Next Monday, dear Molly, if convenient, I shall leave
New York for Greenfield. Mr. Welles says you are
doing a rash thing to invite me, that I am primed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
double-loaded and warranted to go off at any moment,
for he has heard me the last month saying of every new
thing (‘thing’ always being ‘dish’ with me), ‘Molly
and I will do that together when I get there.’ If you
can, imagine how I ache to get away from this hotel and
into a house of my own, with a kitchen and a range.
Never, never again will I consent to be a homeless hotel
waif. However, in two weeks our house will be our
own again,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Molly smiled over her friend’s letter, she knew her so
well. How pleasant it would be to have her in her own
house!</p>

<p>Charlotte Welles was an English woman five years
older than Molly, who had known her long before her
marriage to the rich banker, Mr. Welles.</p>

<p>When Molly and her mother were living in London
in very economical lodgings at South Kensington, they
had become acquainted with Mrs. Morris and her handsome
daughter, whom at first they took to be an art-student
at South Kensington. Charlotte had laughed merrily
at the mistake.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I’m a cooking-student.”</p>

<p>Then she had told Molly and her mother how it was
that being certain she would have to earn her living,
and, though generally clever, having no special talent for
anything, she had chosen her career. “As for being
a governess, I have neither patience nor meekness nor
ability enough, and as cooking is just now coming to be
a recognized profession for women who are not of the
working-class, I decided on that. I don’t find many
<i>ladies</i> among the thorough-going students like myself, but
I do see that no profession offers greater rewards to a
<i>lady</i>,—perhaps for that very reason; so I am qualifying
myself to be a teacher.”</p>

<p>Molly’s mother, invalid as she was, had taught her
daughter more than most girls know of housekeeping,
and her own taste leaned that way, but no doubt her
acquaintance with Charlotte Morris confirmed it; she
went with her sometimes to the demonstrations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
worked with her at home. When the latter left the
school a medallist and went to Liverpool to lecture,
Molly and her mother had gone to the south of France
for the health of the latter, and there they heard of
Charlotte’s success, how her grace and culture (and perhaps
her beauty) made her much in request at ladies’
colleges and schools, and of the public lectures she gave.
But her career was cut short, before it was well begun,
by her engagement to an American banker of wealth,—an
engagement speedily followed by marriage; and it
was through Mrs. Welles that, after her mother’s death,
on returning to her native country, Molly found the position
as governess she had held up to her marriage with
Harry Bishop. Several months before Molly came to
Greenfield Mr. and Mrs. Welles had let their house and
gone to England for a trip, but returned two months before
the tenant’s term was up and had been living at
one of the best hotels since.</p>

<p>True to her old instincts, Mrs. Welles attended all the
best cooking-lectures in whatever city she might be, and
after Molly’s marriage they had gone together to cooking-school
and practiced at her house, which had been
of incalculable service to Molly. Since her return to
America they had not met. It is needless to say she
looked forward to her visit with heartfelt pleasure, for
she felt that to her acquaintance she owed very much.</p>

<p>And how these good things had come just in time!</p>

<p>To-day they were to have a regular boiled dinner,
German soup made from the half leg of mutton boiled,
and an egg beaten in it, the same that she had shown
Mrs. Lennox how to make, and the mutton with caper
sauce, mashed turnips and moulded potatoes, macaroni
cheese, and pudding.</p>

<p>This dinner Marta could cook with written instructions,
all but the pudding, and Molly, now she had jam,
meant this to be an old-fashioned English jam roly-poly.</p>

<p>The written instructions were as follows:</p>

<p>At five o’clock put the half leg of mutton into boiling
water, only enough to cover it; put with it one carrot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cut, one turnip, one onion, and when it has boiled <i>very
slowly</i> half an hour, put in a very scant tea-spoonful of
salt. Put some macaroni to boil. Put the turnips, cut
into strips, on the fire in boiling water at half-past five,
also the potatoes. Let the turnips boil fast, the potatoes
slowly.</p>

<p>Make three gills of white sauce instead of half a
pint, never forgetting when you increase the milk also
to increase butter and flour in same proportion; then
when the macaroni is tender put a layer of it in a small
dish, pour over it a table-spoonful of white sauce and
the same of grated cheese with pepper and salt, then
another layer of macaroni, more white sauce, cheese and
seasoning, and over all strew bread crumbs and bits of
butter, and bake till brown.</p>

<p>The turnips strain when tender and let them stew five
minutes in some of the white sauce made for the macaroni,
reserving the rest for caper sauce. To make it,
add capers in proportion of one good tea-spoonful of capers
to the half pint, and just as it goes to table stir in
a tea-spoonful of caper vinegar; if it stands after this it
will be apt to curdle.</p>

<p>Take up the mutton, put it to keep hot, skim and
strain the broth and let it boil down fast till there is
enough for dinner and no more; beat an egg, mix a
very little of the broth with it, and put both into the
tureen, with a tea-spoonful of parsley chopped fine.
Let the broth remain off the fire one minute, then pour
it to the egg, stirring quickly, then serve it.</p>

<p>Molly had a busy morning arranging her store-room,
and making a list of what it contained. This list she
nailed behind the door, with a pencil attached, so that
when anything was used a mark was made against it.
In this way, when any article was nearly out she would
be reminded to replace it. It was not so necessary, perhaps,
with a girl as careful as Marta, or in her small
family as in a larger one, but it had been her mother’s
way, and she followed it. She could then keep track of
everything at a glance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>One hour and a half before dinner Molly put on a
saucepan of water to boil, and then chopped six ounces
of beef-kidney suet very fine, which she mixed with
half a pound of flour and a pinch of salt. She made a
hole in the centre of the mixture, and poured in enough
cold water to make a stiff firm paste (not so stiff as to
be hard to roll out); it was handled as little as possible,
only worked enough to keep it together. It was rolled
out <i>once</i> to a sheet half an inch thick, then spread with
raspberry jam, which was not allowed to come within an
inch of the edge all round; the edge was wetted, the
paste rolled up and the ends pinched closely to prevent
the jam coming out, as was also the flap along the centre.
A pudding-cloth was scalded and floured, the roly-poly
laid on one side of it and rolled up; each end was tied
close to the paste, and the centre <i>pinned</i>. No string was
passed round the centre, as Molly had sometimes seen
done, for as the pudding swells the string cuts into it.
When finished the cloth was not very loose on the pudding,
nor tight, but what may be called an easy fit.
When it would leave the water, after an hour and
quarter <i>constant</i> boiling, it would be swelled and plump.</p>

<p>Molly saw that the water boiled fast when it was
dropped in, and that there was plenty of it.</p>

<p>“Marta, take care that the pudding never ceases to
boil, and once in a while look that it floats round, so
that it may not stick to the bottom.”</p>

<p>The next day Molly had to make Dresden patties,
and some fritters the recipe for which she had unearthed
from the old last-century book; it was written in the
quaint language and indefinite fashion common to cooking-books
of that date. Molly had often thought, in
reading them, that housekeepers’ wits must have been
much more brilliant in those days, or the books could
have done little good.</p>

<p>But she had thought out the matter, and her knowledge
of old cook-books told her that a “handful” probably
meant a man’s hand full, as the book was written by
a man cook; that when you were told to “beat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
search your sugar” it was because they had not latter-day
improvements and probably no powdered sugar was
sold. Reduced to present-day terms and small dimensions,
the recipe was as follows:</p>

<p>The yolks of two eggs and a tea-spoonful of flour, and
a scant half pint of milk or cream, a pinch of salt, a
quarter of a small nutmeg and a table-spoonful of sugar.
The flour and yolks of eggs to be well beaten with a
little of the milk, the rest to be added warm, and all
beaten very well together with the sugar and salt and
nutmeg. This will make a custard, to be baked in a
shallow round dish till firm, then put to get cold. Make
a batter of a gill of milk (half cream, the recipe called
for), one whole egg and enough flour to make it thick
enough to quite mask the back of a spoon without running
off,—two level table-spoonfuls are about enough;
beat one of the whites of eggs left from the custard till
it will not slip from the dish; put to the batter, which
must be quite smooth, the grated rind of half a lemon,
a pinch of salt, and then add the beaten white of egg,
stirring very slowly after this is in. Cut the custard
into six pieces, pie-fashion, and dip each piece into the
batter, and drop it into boiling lard.</p>

<p>The recipe sounded very well to Molly, and her mind
went over all sorts of improvements in flavoring, from
simply adding vanilla to the introduction of chopped
citron or crumbled macaroons into the custard; but she
would make the recipe as given, or as nearly as she
could interpret it, first.</p>

<p>Although the fritters would be much better hot, perhaps,
the book gave no clew to that; she knew they must
be good warmed over, or even cold, and as she did not
want to leave the dinner-table to attend to the frying,—being
an experiment,—she felt she must do it herself.
She decided to cook them at once; the custard required
very careful handling while it was being dipped in the
batter, and she found the safest plan to prevent breaking
was to pour the batter into a saucer, and take up
the fritter, when dipped, on a broad knife. The batter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
completely hid the custard, and when dropped into the
fat, which was very hot, it puffed up outside and doubled
the size.</p>

<p>They took two minutes to get pale brown, and then
they were laid on paper to drain; and after the sugar
was sifted on them they certainly were pretty to look at,
and at dinner were found to bear out their good appearance,
and Molly added them to her special recipes.</p>

<p>The Dresden patties she wanted Marta to understand
making, because they were so easy, so useful, and so
pretty. With a view to making them, Molly had kept
half a stale loaf that was as light as baker’s bread,—too
light, she thought, for the table; from it she cut two
slices two inches thick and from them she cut, with a
medium sized biscuit-cutter, three rounds; the cutter was
simply a circle of tin with a handle over it, so that the
cutter went right through the bread; had it had a top to
prevent it going through, she would have cut them with
a half-pound baking-powder box. On the top of each
round of bread she cut a smaller circle as for pastry
patties; now she beat an egg, added half a pint of milk
with a pinch of salt, and stood the three patties in it,
telling Marta to let them stay so at least an hour, turning
them about, but being careful not to break them,
the idea being to let the egg and milk soak well into
them, and to make them as moist as possible without
breaking. It will be remembered that one sweetbread
only was cooked two days ago; the other was now cut
into dice, two tea-spoonfuls of flour and butter and a gill
of stock made into béchamel sauce, and the sweetbreads
put to it with a table-spoonful of oyster liquor (as she
happened to have it). This thinned the sauce sufficiently
to let the sweetbreads cook in it without burning.
By the time they were done the sauce would be
reduced again and very thick (or, if it should not be, the
sweetbreads would be taken out, and the sauce boiled
fast and stirred till very thick).</p>

<p>Marta had the lard ready, very hot indeed, when
Molly came out to show her how to fry the patties. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
put them to drain, using a cake-turner, for they would
not bear handling.</p>

<p>“At some times these are rolled in flour, at others in
egg and crumbs, and I think they are prettier for crumbing;
but it is not necessary, and I will save an egg.
Now I am going to drop them into the fat, which is as
hot as it can be without burning. Stand aside, for it
will splutter very much.” Each one was dropped from
the end of the cake-turner, and, as Molly said, they
“spluttered.”</p>

<p>“I leave them on the very hottest part of the fire,
because they are filled with cold custard, which will keep
the temperature about right for five minutes; then draw
them a little aside if they are brown, and let them remain
two minutes.” When taken up they were a bright
brown, looking almost like a doughnut that had been
shaped like a small Charlotte Russe. The centre was
then scooped out, leaving about half an inch of crust all
round, which was filled with the fricasseed sweetbreads
piled in the centre.</p>

<p>“The beauty of these patties is that they can be made
early and heated in the oven, and that they are suitable
for dessert with preserves, or are excellent filled with
any kind of rich minced meat or oysters.”</p>

<p>Molly had long wanted to make an experiment with
oysters; she believed simply panned and served with
brown butter they would be delicious. She had never
heard of “oysters <i>au beurre noir</i>,” but, knowing they
must be good, resolved to try the experiment. She
waited, however, till Harry was in the house, for they
would spoil by standing.</p>

<p>She made the sauce first, because the oysters must not
wait. She put a good table-spoonful of butter into a
little saucepan and watched it till it got golden <i>brown</i>,
but did not burn; then she put it aside to cool a little,
and heated a tea-spoonful of vinegar in a cup, Marta
meantime draining the oysters. They were put in a
stewpan with pepper and salt, covered tightly and set
over the fire and tossed round once or twice, the heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
(but <i>not boiled</i>) vinegar was put to the brown butter,
they were made very hot together, and when the oysters
were plumped in their own steam, they were drained off
and turned into a hot dish, with the brown butter over
them, and served at once. They were such a success
that this became a favorite oyster dish with the Bishop
family.</p>

<p>Molly had not been specially economizing this last
week, and had had some little extra expenses. She was
rejoiced to see that, even so, she had a margin. Of
course, towards the end of October would come an increase
in the price of butter and eggs. This she proposed
to avoid to some extent by ordering at once a pail
of fine October butter at twenty-five cents, which would
last for cooking through the winter, even if it should
not continue sweet enough for such fastidious butter-eaters
as herself and Harry to use at table. Of eggs,
too, she had ordered a gross from a farmer at twenty-five
cents. This would give one dozen a week for
cooking through the twelve weeks when they were dearest,
and within this dozen for cooking she meant to
keep; as soon as they should be dearer, she would
make fewer things that required eggs, and avoid their
use whenever she could do without them. And, so far
as she could, she would supply herself with everything
that would keep during winter and grow dearer as the
months passed; but as the margin she now had reassured
her against any little accidental expenses, she
might safely reckon it would not grow less, unless she
knowingly increased her expenditure for any purpose,
and she would have always a little reserve to meet contingencies
without touching anything outside the ten
dollars a week.</p>

<p>On Monday of the second week in October, Mrs.
Welles was to arrive. Molly did not lay herself out in
great preparations for her, for she knew her friend would
be happiest in being allowed to help her, and do exactly
as if she were in her own home. She knew she could
give her no greater pleasure than by so ordering her
table as to be as different as possible from anything that
money alone could buy; and simple, old-fashioned dishes,
that no hotel would supply in perfection, she would
have during her stay. She did want to arrange, however,
so that she need not even think of luncheon for a
day or two, and would have something in the house.
Happily, in doing this, she could gratify Mrs. Welles’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
English taste, for she would make one of the veal and
ham pies so dear to English palates, so rarely to be
found in perfection out of England. Molly had been
taught by Mrs. Welles herself to make them.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Molly had ordered two pounds of breast
of veal and a pound of very fine ham, cut thin; she
would not need much of it, but the rest would be nice
for breakfast. The breast of veal was cut up into pieces
two inches long and about an inch wide, and put on in
boiling water to simmer <i>very gently</i> one hour, the bones
with it. The water being just enough to cover the
meat, no salt was added, for the meat should retain its
juices. When done, the meat was removed from the
broth, the bones left in it, and all gristly parts and
bones that could not easily be removed when raw cut
from it and thrown back into the saucepan; the meat
was then put aside, and a salt-spoonful of salt, a quarter
one of pepper, and half a bay leaf, with a small pinch of
thyme, one of savory, and two sprigs of parsley, were
put to the broth and bones, and it was left to cook
gently two hours longer; then it was allowed to reduce
to half a pint by boiling faster with the cover off, then
strained and put away. Molly, at the same time, made
some rough puff paste (see recipe, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.), and
left it on the ice till Monday.</p>

<p>This morning, therefore, she had nothing to do but
put the pie together, which she did in the following
way:</p>

<p>The ham she cut in very thin strips, using about a
quarter of a pound. These she poured cold water upon,
and put where they would come slowly to the boiling-point.
Had she had any cold boiled ham, she would
have used it in preference; but she could remove any
strong taste by this parboiling. While it was doing,
she made forcemeat balls thus:</p>

<p>Half a cup of fine bread crumbs, a tea-spoonful of
finely chopped parsley, the eighth of a tea-spoonful each
of powdered thyme and marjoram, one squeeze of lemon
juice; flavor with nutmeg by just rubbing it once across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the grater, a suspicion of lemon peel, a scant salt-spoonful
of salt, a quarter one of pepper. Chop into this a
good table-spoonful of butter (or finely chopped suet, she
would sometimes have used); the whole made into a
stiff paste, with an egg well beaten with a table-spoonful
of water. It did not take all the egg; about a table-spoonful
was left, which Molly reserved to glaze the
pie. In making the forcemeat into paste, she was careful
to handle lightly, not to <i>squeeze</i> or <i>knead</i> it, and
when it was well mixed she sprinkled flour on her
hands, took a tea-spoonful of forcemeat, and made it
into a ball. She used the remainder in the same way.</p>

<p>Then she took a deep oval dish, and put at the bottom
a layer of the ham, then one of veal, and four forcemeat
balls (one at each corner), a little salt and pepper, and a
few more bits of ham, another layer of veal, and half a
dozen forcemeat balls. The dish was now full. She
piled more meat and a little ham towards the centre
till it was dome-shaped, and then filled every crevice
with the strong jelly formed from the meat and bones.</p>

<p>Now she rolled out the paste, and cut a long strip the
third of an inch thick and an inch wide. She wetted
the lip of the dish, laid the paste round, and pressed it
close on the <i>inner</i> side, so that the gravy could not boil
up under it. Then she moistened the upper surface,
laid the sheet of paste over the pie, and with both hands
gently pressed the paste into the groove formed between
the dome shape of the meat and the dish; then, with a
sharp knife, she cut off the overlapping paste, so as not
to drag it in the least; and then, with the back of her
forefinger, laid on the top of the border, pressed the upper
and under paste gently, <i>but closely</i>, together, but was
very careful to leave the <i>edges</i> untouched.</p>

<p>She cut a hole in the centre to let out steam, rolled a
piece of paste very thin, cut from it four diamonds two
inches long from point to point, laid the four, with the
points to the centre, round the hole; and, rolling another
bit of paste as thin as paper, dusted it with flour, folded
it up several times, then turned the four corners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
little many-folded square to form a little ball as large
as an olive, and cut a cross deeply, and with a sharp
knife, across the top; then turned back the corners as if
she were opening a pond-lily bud; and there was a
rough imitation of a flower. This she inserted in the
hole in the pie, which it was large enough to cover,
without closing up too much for the steam to get out.
With a feather she now brushed the pie over with the
yolk of an egg, not leaving a spot untouched, <i>except the
edge</i>, which was not glazed. Molly explained to Marta,
who asked the reason for the omission as she passed on
her way to the boiler, for she was washing.</p>

<p>“If I washed the edges with egg, the paste could not
rise so well; for the leaves would be glued together, as
it were. This is the rule in all use of pastry: <i>Leave the
edges quite untouched;</i> do not even smooth them with
your finger. Smoothing them and pressing them with
your thumb, which I have told you <i>not</i> to do, is the reason
why your pies, even if I make the paste, are never
as handsome as mine. You smooth the life out of the
paste and squeeze all the air from between the leaves
which one is at such trouble to make; and it is the air
that causes the flakes.”</p>

<p>Molly put the pie in the oven, which was about the
right heat for bread,—that is to say, she could count
twenty-five while her hand was held in it. In an hour,
it was pale brown all over. It was taken out of the
oven, and left a few minutes on the table till the contents
had ceased to boil; and then what remained of the
jelly was warmed, the pastry “rose” was lifted gently
from the centre, a funnel inserted in the hole, and the
jelly, warmed, was poured carefully through it into the
pie. Molly watched, while pouring slowly, that the last
disappeared before adding more, for fear the pie might
overflow; then the “rose” was replaced.</p>

<p>This pie is good hot, but in England is always eaten
cold, and cold she knew Mrs. Welles would prefer it.
The great thing to be desired in these cold pies is plenty
of savory jelly in between the meat, and very light
crust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>While the pie was baking, Molly had set the pastry
back on the ice, while she made the filling for some
cheese cakes.</p>

<p>Properly they should be made of <i>sweet</i> curd, dried
and crumbled, hence the name. But Molly had eaten
excellent ones in which ground rice, boiled to thick
mush, was the foundation; others in which bread
crumbs were substituted, the object being to get a body
of some plain material other than flour, with which the
rich ones could be incorporated; but her own favorite
way was to use rolled cracker. She put two heaped
table-spoonfuls in a bowl, and three table-spoonfuls of
sugar. She beat two table-spoonfuls of butter, from
which the salt had been washed, till it creamed, added
the yolks of two eggs, and the juice of half a lemon,
and the peel of one, grated. Then she blanched and
chopped fine as possible two table-spoonfuls of almonds,
and added to them a few drops of bitter almond; then
all were put together, and a large table-spoonful of wine
was added.</p>

<p>Molly tasted to see if the bitter almond was pleasantly
perceptible, and then rolled out the paste and lined patty-pans
with it, taking care to press only the centre to
make it adhere, <i>not the edges;</i> then a large tea-spoonful
was put into each (the patty-pans were small), and they
were put in the oven and baked a beautiful pale brown.
They needed watching closely, as the filling would easily
burn.</p>

<p>The dinner was to be a homely English one, which
would not necessitate her being in the kitchen at all
after her friend arrived, as it would consist of:—</p>

<div class="center">
<i>Clear Soup.</i><br />
<i>Beefsteak Pudding.</i><br />
<i>Stewed Onions.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i>Fried Potatoes.</i><br />
<i>Trifle.</i><br />
</div>

<p>The soup, for which the stock was made on Saturday,
could be left to Marta; also the vegetables. The pudding
required three hours’ constant boiling, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
could be made and be cooking before Charlotte arrived.
The trifle, also, could be ready.</p>

<p>She had bought in the morning half a dozen small
sponge cakes and a dozen macaroons. She now made
some very thick custard with the yolks of two eggs, a
small tea-spoonful of corn starch and half a pint of milk,
and sugar to taste.</p>

<p>The milk was put on to boil, the corn starch mixed
with a very little of it, cold, and stirred into the hot
milk. Both were boiled together five minutes; then it
was allowed to cool very little, and the beaten yolks
and sugar added. The object of boiling the corn starch
is to <i>cook</i> it, as, after the eggs are in, the custard must
not boil, but only be kept at boiling-point till they
thicken. (See directions for boiling custard, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX">Chapter
XXIX</a>.)</p>

<p>When the custard was made, it was flavored with almond,
set to cool, and Molly laid the sponge cakes in a
glass dish, about two inches deep. She poured a glass
of wine over them, moistening them thoroughly, and
sprinkled them with sugar thickly. Over this she
spread a layer of raspberry jam half an inch thick; then
the macaroons were laid over it. Then she poured the
cold custard on it. While it had been getting cold, she
whipped half a pint of cream, sweetened and flavored
with vanilla. This was now piled high over the custard,
and it was put in the ice-box to get very cold. At
the last it was to be decorated with little knobs of red
currant jelly and blanched almonds cut in strips.</p>

<p>Now there was the pudding to make. She was getting
all done early, because she was going to meet Mrs.
Welles; but the pudding would not be injured by standing
half an hour before it went into the water, which it
should do at three o’clock.</p>

<p>She had a pound and a half of very fine, juicy round
steak. This she cut into pieces an inch or so square,
rejecting all gristle and skin, but using a very little of
the fat. This meat she seasoned highly with pepper
and salt, stirring it up among the pieces. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
made a suet crust (see recipe, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>.) and
greased very well a quart bowl. When the crust was
rolled to an even half inch thick, she laid the sheet in
the bowl, pressing it gently all round. Into this she
put the meat, and, when the bowl was <i>full</i>, poured in
a half cup of water; then she gathered up the overlapping
paste, and pinched it together to form a cover, <i>leaving
no cracks</i> through which the gravy could get out.
A floured cloth was now put over the pudding, and a
string passed twice round the flaring parts and tied securely.
The four ends of the cloth were brought over
the top and tied. The pudding could be lifted by these
knotted ends as if it were a basket or bundle.</p>

<p>Marta had now done washing and cleared up, and was
able to attend to Molly’s directions.</p>

<p>“Marta, I shall see this pudding in the pot before I
go to the train, and watch it come to the boiling-point
quickly again; but you must remember it must never
cease boiling, or it will be heavy. When you go to take
it up, remove the cloth and string; then run a thin
knife round close to the bowl, and turn it out gently
on a hot dish, trying not to break the pudding in doing
so.”</p>

<p>Molly had the water on in a pot, that it might be
ready boiling by three; and, although she had warned
Marta to keep it boiling, she did not mean to trust entirely
to her for it, but would come herself to look at it
every half hour or so.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the eggs had come, and Molly
had waiting ready a keg half filled with lime-water,
made by dissolving one pound of quicklime in a gallon
of water, allowed to stand all day and then poured clear
from the sediment. The sediment was rather more than
the mere sprinkling it should have been, and she feared
it might be too strong, and added more water and again
let it settle, when it nearly all dissolved; the rule being
to put in as much lime as will just dissolve, leaving only
sediment enough to show that this point is reached.
She then very carefully put in the eggs, washing every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
soiled one, and warned Marta never to stir them, and,
when taking them out, to be very careful, as one broken
or cracked would spoil the whole; if this occurs, fresh
lime-water must be used.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<small>TOWN VERSUS COUNTRY—THE SERVANT QUESTION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with a heart full of happy content that Molly
started to meet Mrs. Welles, and when the train slowed
into the depot, she saw a well-known head, with bright
chestnut hair, leaning out of the window.</p>

<p>The next moment they were exchanging greetings
like two gay school-girls, for they were both warm-hearted,
impetuous women, and apt to be rather regardless
of bystanders and appearances.</p>

<p>“Dear girl, you look so well,” said her friend, holding
her off a minute to look at her. “I see Harry is not
killing you with kindness, as I used to predict he would.”</p>

<p>“And you, too, look well, notwithstanding the hotel
life you abhor so. Where is your trunk?”</p>

<p>“I had it expressed to your house from the hotel.
It saves all bother, and I knew you and I would enjoy
the walk home together, as you are so near the station.”</p>

<p>And enjoy it they did, as only women who have
known each other in girlhood and made plans and
dreamed dreams together can. The village street was
as prosy as any other Jersey village; but to these two,
who recalled London days, as they went through it, it
was poetical enough; and as they left the little stores
and faced the country in all its autumn glory of color,
and the sweet fall odors of ripening fruit met them,
Mrs. Welles drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“How lovely this is! No wonder you look well.
What a waste it is, after all, to live in the city!”</p>

<p>“There is something to say on both sides, Harry
thinks. We gain all that nature gives in the country,
but we lose art and many things that brighten one’s wits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
But people who have a very narrow income can enjoy
very few of the advantages of city life, even if they live
in it; so, for them, the country is undoubted gain.”</p>

<p>When they reached the house, Mrs. Welles was delighted
with it and everything about it, and made Molly
tell her all about her housekeeping and how she managed.
When she had given her a sketch of her daily
life, Mrs. Welles said, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“That is all very nice, Molly; but it seems to me
you must have a good deal to do, or else your Marta is
a treasure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a good deal to do, and Marta is in one
sense a treasure, though, at the same time, I can see that
many people would not get along with her. Her good
qualities seem to be cleanliness (although she is not
tidy), and an ambition to be a good cook; but for general
work she needs constant watching and telling.
Still, annoying as that is, I do not know that one can
expect more in a girl like her than willingness to do the
work laid out for her. If I were paying for trained
service, I should be dissatisfied; but there are few
trained girls who will undertake general work.”</p>

<p>“That seems to me a matter of course. A girl who
is anxious to rise is one who will try to learn how to do
it, and it would be hard if one expected her to remain
always in an inferior position. If we do that, I think
we remove the strongest incentive to good work—the
ambition to better herself. I think it is the general
lack of such ambition among girls, the non-recognition
of it as one of the conditions of service by ladies, that
makes the great difference between our English servants
and those here.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you are right,” said Molly; “and that
seems to me the true solution of the servant difficulty.
Young girls must learn that high wages and lighter work
are to be attained by proficiency; that they can look on
first places, where low wages only ought to be expected,
as apprenticeships, and every succeeding one to be a
step higher toward the comfortable and well-paid position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
an accomplished servant of any branch ought to
be able to command. But this is something that depends
on the ladies themselves. So long as they pay
the competent and incompetent nearly alike, and do not
insist on testimonials, not only as to respectability and
temper, but <i>proficiency</i> in duties undertaken, there is
not much encouragement to an ambitious girl, or at
least she sees she can get along without making special
effort, and that, if she does make it, she will meet with
the discouraging fact that she is in competition with
those who have made no effort.”</p>

<p>“Still, one would think that is a thing that would cure
itself. Every one would rather pay competent servants
than incompetent.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if they know it. But when two girls
come well recommended, how can you or I tell which is
the really competent one, if, as is often the case, a good-natured
lady has taken her servant’s good qualities, her
amiability and willingness, more into account than the
efficient discharge of her duties? I have kept my eyes
wide open on this subject, and find that a neat-looking,
willing girl will nearly always keep a place, even if not
competent for its duties, and be well recommended when
she leaves; not, as justice demands, recommended for
the qualities she actually has, but also for general competence.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Welles looked slyly at Molly.</p>

<p>“And what character would you give Marta?”</p>

<p>“Now, that is hardly fair. I see the evil. I don’t
say I can do anything to remedy it; that has to be a
general movement. When I am in Rome, I suppose I
should do as the Romans do; yet I would try to be very
specific. But it would do no good. If Marta leaves
me and applies for a place as first-class cook she will get
it. Some few ladies will need some more corroboration
than her word and my letter, testifying to general good
conduct; but many will readily take her, and she will
stay a month or two, if not longer, get large wages
enough to make it as profitable to wait for another well-paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
place if she does not readily find it. A girl recommended
as clean and willing will get a place as cook if
she has the hardihood to assert her ability; yet who
would employ a carpenter simply for his amiability?”</p>

<p>“Then you would have apprenticeship among servants
as among artisans?”</p>

<p>“Of course, if it could be, I would; in other countries
there is practical apprenticeship without bonds, that ensures,
to the painstaking employer who does her best for
a girl, not losing her the moment she has learnt the first
rudiments of housework, and her apprentice year would
be at low wages; she would have the option of advancing
her year by year, or of letting her go and taking
a fresh ‘prentice’ hand.”</p>

<p>“I pity the woman.”</p>

<p>“So do I, yet it is just what we all do more or less
without any distinct benefit. Of course no reasonable
person would expect a girl to remain at the low wages
when she became worth more.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking, Molly. You will
make Marta worth a good deal more than $10 a month
as wages go.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I shall be content to give her $12
when she can do my work with only superintendence
on my part, and later on I shall expect her to ask me
$14; and I shall have to decide to give it, or take
some one else; yet, if she does her best till then I shall
not feel ill used, things being as they are. We can’t
expect a young woman like Marta to be better than her
times.”</p>

<p>“Still, this comes back to the same point; <i>you</i> have a
good deal to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what better employment can I have? We
live about as comfortably as if we kept two servants,
because I do much of the lighter work; I have no drudgery.
Marta does that. I have very few social duties. I
have plenty of time to read and do my little sewing and we
live as I like to live; I should not be so happy any other
way. When I have children I shall have less time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I expect Marta will be able to go on pretty well with an
hour of my time in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“But suppose Marta wants to leave?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she will. She seems to have the European
horror of changing and, I think, believes herself
part of the family. If I am mistaken I shall be unfortunate,
but my altering my policy now would not change
matters. I made up my mind to expect very little beyond
hand work from one servant; that I have got.”</p>

<p>They chatted till Harry came home, Mrs. Welles unable
to make up her mind whether Molly’s ideas were
wise or foolish; as <i>ideas</i> they were good, of course, but
how would they work in practice? Mrs. Welles was
too English to understand why a woman should make up
her mind to put up with half service, and she had been
too well off since she had been married to have learnt by
experience.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>OX-TAIL SOUP—GRISINI—STEWED LAMB AND
PEAS—MÉRINGUES WITH CREAM.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Welles’s</span> trunk arrived the next morning and
Molly found her friend had come as she said, “prepared
and loaded for a kitchen campaign.” Several little things
not easily obtained in a country town she had brought,
and last of all she handed out a paper package.</p>

<p>“There, Molly, I thought, perhaps, you had none, and
I have two or three recipes needing the stuff, so I made
sure and brought it with me.”</p>

<p>Molly had meanwhile cut the strings and saw in the
paper a thick roll of something wrapped in waxed paper.</p>

<p>“Ah, almond paste! I wished when I was chopping
almonds the other day that I had some.”</p>

<p>The almond paste was a substance that looked, in
color and appearance, like very heavy bread: it was
almonds ground by machinery, and saved infinite time
in preparing almonds for macaroons, cake, etc.</p>

<p>“There, Mistress Molly, you see we are going to make
goodies while I am here.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do my part and sit at your feet
again.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Molly, I have nothing to teach you. You
were too intelligent not to see, when you had the key to
a few things, that the rest was a matter of experiment
and practice; but while I was in London I had some recipes
given to me, vaguely written, as amateur recipes
usually are, but I want to try to get them right.”</p>

<p>Molly, mindful of her guest’s English tastes, had asked
her butcher to save her two ox-tails, as they were very
cheap things, and she prepared them for soup while Mrs.
Welles finished her unpacking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>First, she cut up the tails into joints and each joint of
the root of it into three, then put them on the fire, in
cold water, let it come to the boiling-point, drained
them off and pumped cold water on them. This was the
process called “blanching,” so often directed in cooking-books
without further explanation. They were then
dried in a cloth, dusted with flour, put in a pot with a
table-spoonful of butter, and fried a bright brown and
frequently stirred round, to color them evenly; then she
cut up a carrot, a turnip, and an onion, and put them
into it, then added a bay leaf, three sprigs of parsley,
half a salt-spoonful of thyme and marjoram, two cloves,
a tea-spoonful and a half of salt, and half a salt-spoonful
of pepper and two quarts of water. This was to simmer
four hours; at the end of the second hour a few of the
nicest joints of the tail were taken out to serve in the
soup, the others left to boil down with it. Half an hour
before dinner the soup was strained and a table-spoonful
of brown thickening (recipe in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>.) stirred
into it to make it the consistency of very thin cream.
As it boiled down it would grow thicker; then it was put
to boil fast, without a cover, and every few minutes
skimmed. When quite clear of fat, the joints of the tail
were put in, a glass of wine added,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the soup was
ready to serve.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bishop’s turn was near to receive the
reading-club, and Molly had thought it would be pleasant
to have it the week Charlotte was with her. The lady
entertaining could, of course, invite any of her friends,
and Molly asked Mr. and Mrs. Lennox. Mrs. Welles
was delighted to help, and the afternoon was given to a
discussion of what should be provided.</p>

<p>“We are wisely limited as to what is to constitute
the refreshment. There must be no oysters or ice cream,
only cakes and sandwiches and coffee and tea, or chocolate.”</p>

<p>“No <i>bouillon?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes, that has been admitted in place of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
other beverages, as so many can’t take coffee or tea at
night.”</p>

<p>“Let’s say coffee and <i>bouillon</i>, then, and sandwiches.
Are you limited to one kind?”</p>

<p>“No. Mrs. Framley, last week, had tongue, cheese
and chicken.”</p>

<p>“Well, have chicken and lobster then. How many
guests shall you expect?”</p>

<p>“About thirty-four.”</p>

<p>I suppose it is not necessary to go further into figures
at this day to show that Molly was likely to do all she
had undertaken to do on her allowance of ten dollars a
week, but as her evening was a great success and cost
very little, I will give the details to show how it was
done and what the actual cost was. The flavorings
formed part of Molly’s stores and the almond paste was
given to her, yet I add the price here, for those who
may wish to go and do likewise may not be so fortunate.
Although the list of articles were ordered, they
were not all used.</p>

</div>

<p>The first thing was to make four loaves of nice bread;
this Molly did, using two quarts of water and one cake
of yeast (see recipe for bread, <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV</a>.). To save
trouble of cutting, Mrs. Welles suggested pipe bread
(<i>grisini</i>) to eat with the <i>bouillon</i>, and before the bread
was put to rise a piece was broken from the dough of
the size of a large orange; to this was added the white
of an egg, whipped a little, a tea-spoonful of powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sugar and a good tea-spoonful of butter softened. When
it was all well incorporated, flour, warmed and sifted,
was added to bring it to the consistency of stiffish bread-dough.
It was kneaded long and well and set to rise.
It took longer than the bread, because it was a little
stiffer and also the bread and additional flour weakened
the yeast. When it had swelled well, however, Mrs.
Welles and Molly sat down together to roll it, while
Marta attended to the dinner, which was to consist of
soup, stewed lamb and peas, stuffed potatoes and <i>méringues</i>,
with whipped cream.</p>

<p>The <i>méringues</i> had been made in the morning and the
cream whipped. The stewed lamb was something so
simple that it could be left to Marta, although in leaving
any stewing or boiling to Marta, now or any other time,
Molly never omitted an occasional glance to see that it
neither left off <i>simmering</i> and that the simmering had
not become <i>boiling</i>.</p>

<p>“The rolling out of <i>grisini</i> is a very tedious task,”
said Mrs. Welles, “but the compensation is that they
keep as well as crackers, once made.”</p>

<p>“You will have to direct me, Charlotte, as I have
never made these before.”</p>

<p>“All you have to do is to roll a small piece of dough
under your hands on the board, so, till it is no thicker
than a pencil. If the dough is too soft—it should be
stiffer than bread-dough, yet quite elastic—you can add
a very little flour.” As she spoke she laid her two
hands over a bit of dough as large as a hickory nut and
began rolling, pressing pretty hard as she rolled.</p>

<p>“If they do not roll smooth, wet your palm with milk
slightly.”</p>

<p>Molly followed directions. As each pipe was made it
was laid on a baking-pan. They were irregular in
length, but generally about nine or ten inches long.</p>

<p>It took them half an hour to roll them, for it was difficult
at first for Molly to get hers of fairly even thickness
all the way down, but practice brought facility.
The dough made about three dozen, and they were put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in a warm place to swell till as thick as a medium-sized
cigar. Then they were to be baked in a <i>cool</i> oven <i>half
an hour</i>. They were to be very lightly colored, when
done, about like pilot biscuits, and should snap short;
hence the slow oven, as they must dry as well as cook.</p>

<p>The bread had not been set till early in the morning,
so that it might bake late in the day, for Molly’s reception
was to be on Friday—this was Wednesday—and
she wanted the bread to be as near as possible two days
old, for sandwiches, yet not at all stale. The <i>bouillon</i>
and cakes would be made Thursday, and there would be
nothing but the sandwiches to cut and coffee to make on
the day itself. Molly was anxious to get all done before
that, so as to be quite fresh for her friends.</p>

<p>Before leaving the kitchen she went over the recipes
she had written for Marta’s guidance, emphasizing all
important points. For the stewed lamb there were some
lean chops from under the shoulder (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>.);
these were floured and laid in a stewpan with a little butter
and fried brown, an onion cut up and a piece of carrot
(half a small one), and enough hot water barely to
cover them was poured on them with half a tea-spoonful
of salt. They were to stew very slowly for two
hours, then taken up and kept hot while the gravy was
skimmed and allowed to boil down to half a pint, a large
teaspoonful of brown thickening was put into it and a
can of peas, and seasoned to taste, then the meat was returned
and allowed to stew very gently a quarter of an
hour more.</p>

<p>Harry had been told laughingly he was to expect a
very plain dinner.</p>

<p>“And is that the result of having two expert cooks in
the house? Mrs. Welles, I’ve been petting my digestion
for the last month in order to cope with the culinary productions
of the pair of you, and this is the result. I’ve
heard before that too many cooks spoil the broth, but I
didn’t know it extended to the whole dinner.”</p>

<p>Although Molly had made the <i>méringues</i> herself, she
had written the recipe, which is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Beat the white of two eggs as stiff as possible, that is
to say, till it will not slip out of the bowl, then stir into
it <i>very gently</i> three ounces of powdered sugar, remembering
the rule that anything to be mixed with white of
egg must be done with a light <i>lifting</i> motion of the spoon,
rather than <i>stirring</i>, which may liquefy the eggs. Fill
a table-spoon with the mixture and turn on to a sheet of
white paper placed on a board which has been made a
little damp; the moulds should be oval, like half an egg.
Put them in a very cool oven for fifteen or twenty minutes,
then open the door and leave them ten minutes
longer; the idea is to make the crust as thick as possible,
which is done by the long slow drying; if firm enough
remove them from the paper, take out the moist centre
very carefully, and when cold fill them with cream,
flavored, sweetened, and whipped solid (recipe <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVIII">Chapter
XXVIII</a>.), then put two together; they should be <i>over</i>
full, and the cream show considerably between the two
sides.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<small>MACAROONS—JUMBLES—GENOESE TABLETTES—IRISH
STEW.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Mrs. Welles and Molly were in the
kitchen bright and early. She had ordered the day before
all she would need for dinner, and did not require
to leave the house. They had planned to make macaroons
and fancy cakes. For the macaroons, half a
pound of almond paste and three quarters of a pound of
powdered sugar were weighed carefully, then three
large eggs were separated and beaten. Mrs. Welles
put the almond paste in the chopping-bowl, and chopped
it into fine crumbs (which saves a good deal of mashing
with a fork), while Molly beat eggs and added the sugar,
making icing, in fact; then the crumbled almond paste
was put to it and mashed with the back of a fork into
the icing, till it was all smooth and perfectly blended;
some sheets of thin paper were rubbed with suet and
cut to fit the dripping-pan, on which they were to be
baked; half a tea-spoonful was dropped on a bit of
paper, and put in to try the oven, and meanwhile a
dozen or so of almonds were blanched and each split
into six.</p>

<p>The macaroon, when looked at, had flattened down, as
it should do, but just a shade more than was just right,
and a tea-spoonful more powdered sugar was stirred in.
Then the mixture was taken up on the end of a tea-spoon,
and bits as large as small nutmegs were dropped
on the greased paper,—about two inches apart,—and
then on each of them three or four bits of almond were
put irregularly. The oven was moderate,—not too
cool, nor yet hot enough to color them till they had
been in it ten minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“While you bake those, I’ll make some Genoese
pastry,” said Mrs. Welles.</p>

<p>“That is a novelty to me; at least, I have heard of it,
but not tried it. If I remember rightly you told me you
had once tried it, but found it very unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was too sticky while warm to cut, and too
brittle when cold, but I have now another recipe which
I want to try, and if it is good it will be just the thing
for your fancy cakes. This is the recipe:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Genoese pastry.</span>—Four ounces of flour, three of
butter, four of almond paste, and five eggs. Melt the
butter in a bowl, taking care it does not get very hot.
Break the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar to
them, stand the bowl in a saucepan of boiling water, and
whip eggs and sugar for twenty minutes, but they must
not get very hot; take the bowl from the water, add the
almond paste, crumbled fine, to it, beat till smooth, then
add the butter, and last of all slip in the flour, stirring
lightly all the time; bake, in a round jelly-cake-pan
lined with buttered paper very neatly fitted and standing
an inch above the edge, in a rather quick oven for
half an hour. When it is done, no mark should remain
on it when pressed with the finger.”</p>

<p>“Has any one you know tried the recipe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; and I have eaten the cake, and found it
excellent.”</p>

<p>Molly now opened the oven to look at the macaroons,
and found they could be put for one minute at the top,
to take a deeper tint, and another pan which she had
ready could be put in the bottom of the oven.</p>

<p>Then she prepared one more sheet, after taking the
first from the oven. These she left on the pan to cool
a few minutes before touching them; then she lifted
the paper from it, replaced it by a fresh one, and did not
attempt to take the macaroons from the paper till they
were nearly cold. She handled them after they were
baked, and until cold, as if they were egg shells.</p>

<p>Marta, who had now finished her morning’s work, was
told to put on the <i>bouillon</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must take the largest pot, Marta; that shin
weighs eight pounds. It is cut in three, but gash it
well, take out the marrow, and put on eight quarts of
cold water; when it is near the boiling-point, skim it,—take
care the scum does not break. After it is off, throw
in a wine-glass of cold water and wait; when it is once
again near boiling, skim again; repeat the cold water
and skimming twice, then leave it to boil four hours
very slowly.”</p>

<p>When separating the yolks of eggs from the whites,
for the macaroons, they had been at once beaten with
a tea-spoonful of cold water to prevent hardening,—which
they are apt to do when waiting even a very
short time, if not beaten,—and set aside for jumbles,
which Molly made while Mrs. Welles made the Genoese
pastry. She used for them six ounces of butter, six
ounces of sugar, and half a pound of flour, with the
yolks of the three eggs. The butter was beaten to a
cream and then the sugar and eggs added, the flour sifted
in, a table-spoonful of wine put in, and when all was
well mixed a few drops of extract of rose was added,
Molly tasting the paste to judge the quantity. It needed
to be perceptible, as it goes off in baking. Then she
rolled it into little balls about the size of a hickory nut,
and on some stuck half a blanched almond, on others a
little bit of green citron, and on others a strip of candied
lemon peel.</p>

<p>Rolling them thus was much less trouble than cutting
them into rings and shaping them in sugar, and
quite as sightly, for the balls melt down in the oven into
round cakes. They require a moderate oven; if too
slow they melt too much, if too quick they burn before
they are done.</p>

<p>To keep the oven just right this morning when a
steady, moderate heat was required, Molly attended to
the fire herself. Having seen that it was solid at first,
she kept it so by adding a very few coals <i>before</i> it had
shown any signs of going down. As soon as the jumbles
were firm and the bright yellow had changed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
palest pine color, they were taken out, without waiting
for them to <i>brown</i> at all.</p>

<p>The Genoese pastry was now done; it looked like a
thick jelly-cake, and when cool was to be cut and jelly
laid between it sandwich-fashion, and some pieces iced
plain.</p>

<p>When the macaroons were taken off the papers, there
were found to be between seventy and eighty, but as in
two pans there were two or three that had sunken somewhat
and were less handsome than the rest, those were
laid aside. There were also nearly four dozen jumbles,
and there would be about three dozen <i>tablettes</i> from the
Genoese pastry.</p>

<p>It was getting near luncheon time and they were both
rather tired; therefore they gave up till after they had
eaten and rested.</p>

<p>“I hope, Molly, you take care of yourself in this
way,” said her friend as they sat down to a comfortable
lunch. “I remember how you used to horrify me in London
by going without food for hours, or only eating cake
or pastry, if you had anything on hand to interest you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, nowadays I do, whether I feel hungry or not:
I sit down and force myself to eat, and I do it leisurely
also, for if I finish eating in ten minutes I take
a book or newspaper and spend the full hour resting,
then I go to work fresh again; although I confess I
do it often in spite of my nerves, which urge me to finish.
But I do it, and I know that eating nothing at all
or a mere snack in a hurry, at noon, and then keeping
on with the sewing, or preserving, or shopping, is what
wears out half us American women. I used to get tired
and faint about three o’clock, after doing very little,
and was almost ashamed that I, a healthy young girl,
should do so when I saw elderly women keep on from
morning till night. You and your mother first awakened
me to the fact that it was lack of food. My own dear
mother had been like myself all her life, neglecting her
noon meal, simply because she never felt hungry. <i>Now</i>
I get a meal of some substantial kind, and I make Marta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
do the same, for she also is inclined to take a standing
lunch,—just a bit of bread and cheese, she likes best.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe people can work well if they
do not eat sensibly. I can eat three meals comfortably,
but I agree with Dr. Richardson: we could do without
both the others better than the mid-day meal. I suppose
if you and I had kept on for a couple of hours longer we
should have been a pair of wilted beings.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is nothing like leaving off and resting
<i>before</i> one is really tired, if one wants to get through a
great deal without feeling it; but it is a very difficult
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“I know it; especially difficult to those who need it
most,—the nervous, energetic women; to the phlegmatic
ones it comes easy enough, and they seldom overwork.”</p>

<p>“I have eaten the last of your ‘weal and hammer,’
my dear, and I agree with Silas Wegg: ‘it mellars the
organ,’—and now I am ready for work. The next
thing is to ice those cakes, I suppose, and I will put on
the sugar to boil.”</p>

<p>“No, I have French icing ready, but I forgot until
this minute to make some coloring; I bought the cochineal
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s plenty of time; it will only take a few
minutes; I’ll put it to boil and we will both get the
Genoese cakes ready while it does so.”</p>

<p>Molly handed to her a packet containing an ounce of
cochineal and one of cream of tartar, mixed; this was
put to boil in half a pint of water, and was to reduce to
half. While this was going on Molly got out some
raspberry jam and the lemon paste she had made.</p>

<p>“I wonder what I should have done if these good
things had not come so apropos!”—alluding to her
mother-in-law’s gift.</p>

<p>“Done, my dear? You would not have felt the lack
of them; you would just have made your jumbles and
some cocoanut macaroons and cones; made some sponge
drop-cakes, which you would have iced, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
forgotten to wish even that you had not the other
things; I know you, Molly.”</p>

<p>Molly laughed. “To tell the truth, I had thought the
matter over, and decided to make some orange paste, for
which I have a very old recipe, and as two oranges are
enough, it would not have been very costly.”</p>

<p>“Before I go away I want to try it, if oranges are to
be got yet, out here.”</p>

<p>“I saw a few pale things, but Harry can bring some
early Floridas.”</p>

<p>As they talked they worked. The bread-board was
put between them, and the Genoese cake was split carefully
into four even layers. The rounded sides were
trimmed off wide enough to cut into odd-shaped pieces
to be dipped into icing.</p>

<p>The cochineal had now boiled fast about ten minutes
uncovered, and by the rim round the little saucepan
showed it had diminished to one-half.</p>

<p>“Now if one can avoid getting one’s fingers in it,
and looking like an executioner for a day or two, it will
be very nice; where’s the alum, Molly?”</p>

<p>Molly handed the tiny packet containing two drachms
of alum to Mrs. Welles. It was put into the cochineal,
stirred, and then a small strainer was put on a cup, a
piece of muslin laid in it, and the coloring poured
through it; then the ends of the muslin were gathered
together and the sediment gently pressed with a spoon
and then thrown away.</p>

<p>Molly, meanwhile, had been spreading one of the
layers of cake with the lemon paste, very thinly, and
laid another on top of it,—this was one cake; the other
layer was spread with raspberry jam, and on that also
a slice was laid. I have said that the rounded sides
were cut off, leaving the centre square. These sides
were cut into three-cornered pieces; there were, consequently,
a number of these corner pieces, and two
square cakes,—one with raspberry jam, one with
lemon. Molly had brought out the French or <i>fondant</i>
icing, the vanilla flavoring, the bitter almond, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
caramel coloring. She divided the icing, putting one
part into a small bowl which she set in a saucepan of
boiling water, stirring it till it was creamy. Mrs. Welles
had laid a sheet of confectioner’s paper on the board,
and when the icing was melted, Molly brought it to the
table and put to it a very small half tea-spoonful of vanilla,
and stirred it; then she dipped a table-spoon in the
boiling water, shook the water from it and then took it
full of the icing from the bowl and poured it on the
layers of cake containing the lemon, and spread it, using
more icing as she needed it, smoothing it with a knife
dipped into boiling water and shaken.</p>

<p>When it was done, Mrs. Welles warmed a knife and
cut the cake into neat <i>tablettes</i> an inch wide and two
inches long, while Molly put the same icing over the
fire, stirred it slowly till the water under it was boiling,
and the icing creamy. She took it to the table,
colored it a beautiful creamy coffee color with a few
drops of caramel, and then dropped the corner pieces,
one by one, as fast as she could, into it, taking them out
as soon as they were covered, and laying them on the
waxed paper with a fork. Before half were done the icing
got stiff, and she had to put it on the fire once more;
and this time, as each heating up made the icing a degree
higher candy, she put in a few drops of water from the
end of a spoon,—a dozen drops perhaps in all,—then
the icing became creamy again. She finished dipping
the cakes, all but three or four, for which the icing fell
short. Now the other portion of icing was put in a
bowl, melted to cream in boiling water, a few drops
of cochineal added to it, and a few drops (very few) of
almond flavoring. The cochineal made it a beautiful
pale pink. This was laid on the <i>tablette</i> of cake in which
was raspberry jam, in the same way as the white, and it
also was cut into <i>tablettes</i> while Molly dipped the rest
of her three-cornered pieces of cake into the pink icing.</p>

<p>There was now a plate of pink, almond-iced <i>tablettes</i>
with raspberry jam; one of white, vanilla-iced <i>tablettes</i>
with lemon filling, and on the sheet of waxed paper lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
several that looked like large, oblong, French candies,
pink and pale coffee-colored,—being completely covered
with icing, no one could tell they were cake.</p>

<p>“Now the cakes are all made, are they not?” asked
Mrs. Welles.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I’m sadly afraid people will think they
have cost much more than is usually spent at these
meetings; but I know they have not. Mrs. Framley
had sponge cake only, yet the eggs alone for the five
loaves she made would cost more than these cakes.”</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be helped,” said Mrs. Welles.</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Molly; “I meant only to have the
iced jelly cakes, and though Genoese is so delicious I
don’t know that that difference will be understood, but
your bringing the almond paste tempted me into the
macaroons, and then to make use of the yolks; of course
they led to the jumbles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they would pass; it is the ‘Frenchy’ look
of the iced cakes that will seem costly, but you can tell
your friends what the cost really is.”</p>

<p>“I know, only I hate to seem to lay myself out; yet
when things can be made so pretty one can’t resist doing
it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, because you love the work as others love
Kensington stitch and can’t resist adding to the beauty
of their surroundings in that way. You and I resist
that temptation very well, but this makes one understand
it. All work is pleasure if you love it and <i>know
how</i> to do it.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ll see the dinner on and we’ll adjourn and
leave Marta in possession,” said Molly.</p>

<p>Molly looked at the <i>bouillon</i>, which had been simmering
four hours; and Marta asked if she should put in
the vegetables.</p>

<p>“No; this is to be extra strong, in fact <i>consommé</i>,—which
means <i>bouillon</i> very much reduced,—so this can
simmer two hours more; then strain the meat from it,
and to-morrow you can take off all fat; and then put to
it two carrots cut up small, two turnips, two onions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and let them boil in it two hours; this will reduce it
enough; then it can be strained and cleared.”</p>

<p>Molly had arranged to have for dinner just such
things as Marta could cook, but the substantial part of
it was to be Irish stew, that good old savory dish. Excellent
as it is when well made, there is nothing more
“poverty seeming” than the same thing carelessly done;
therefore she meant to see it all on to cook before leaving
the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irish Stew.</span>—Half a dozen lean chops from the
neck were floured and put in a saucepan with two onions
and a tea-spoonful of butter, and quickly browned; but
the onion was not allowed to burn, and therefore it was
all kept moving about. A pint of cold water was then
put to it, and the fat that this brought to the surface
skimmed off and a tea-spoonful of salt and one third
of a tea-spoonful of pepper added. It was put where
it would simmer <i>very gently</i> for an hour and a half,
when it was to be again skimmed, and a tea-spoonful of
Worcestershire sauce put to it; the gravy tasted to see if
salt enough, and half a dozen large potatoes (or more
if small) cut in half; then it was to be closely covered
and was to simmer for another hour. Molly cautioned
Marta against adding more water.</p>

<p>“When you put the potatoes in, never mind if the
gravy does not cover them; they are to stew over the
meat; sufficient good gravy to serve is all that is necessary,
if you cover the potatoes with liquid as often is
done, you get a good deal of broth, but no gravy.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />

<small>TO BOIL AND PREPARE LOBSTER—SANDWICHES—CLEARING
SOUP—OMELET SOUFFLÉ.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the lobster which Molly had ordered
was sent; it was quite a large one, and it was put
on <i>head downward</i> into boiling water in which there
were four table-spoonfuls of salt to the gallon. Marta
was told to let it boil gently half an hour, then to take
it out, as if it boils too long the meat becomes tough and
stringy; but, although Marta had that order and Molly
left the kitchen to go through her usual morning duties
up-stairs, Mrs. Welles noticed that when the half hour
was up Molly herself went to see that Marta had not
forgotten.</p>

<p>“My dear Molly, a Marta would be the death of me,
or I of her, if I had one.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“She requires such endless looking after. Why don’t
you get a more experienced girl?”</p>

<p>“Because perhaps the experienced girl would be the
‘death of me.’ I mean it is unlikely the experience
would exactly fit my needs, and if it did not, it would be
in the way of her learning my ways.”</p>

<p>“Does Marta learn?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she does—slowly; but remember, she is so
newly arrived.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not her accomplishments I disparage, but
that you cannot trust her to carry out such a simple order
as to take a thing out of water at a certain time.
What made you give the order if you did not expect to
have it remembered?”</p>

<p>“Moral effect, I suppose,” laughed Molly. “I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
pretend to leave things to Marta, but as a matter of
fact, it was the very simplicity of this thing that made
me careful; Marta is impressed, I find, with large appearances;
if I tell her to do something that is to have
some very choice result, although I expect her to blunder,
she generally surprises me by carrying out the order
well, because she is impressed, and all her attention
on the alert. She can do three or four things now she
is proud of; one is frying, because she has completely
mastered the art, and the results are so showy; then she
has lived in Germany as scullion, where she has heard
fine cooking spoken of with respect, and knows it is
worth doing well. The difficulty lies generally in the
fact that half our servants don’t know that there is such
a thing as standard cooking; anything beyond their ken
is ‘new-fangled,’ and is a mystery not worth knowing.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I admire your patience; I never could
emulate it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you would, if it were only necessary; but
with you it is not; you have several servants, and can
import your cooks specially trained.”</p>

<p>“Molly, I could do without servants easily; I would,
rather than watch and follow as you do Marta.”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk over this another time. I’m sure you
would not, for long, like to do without a pair of willing,
if clumsy hands; a dirty servant, I grant, you are better
without,—but I must go down.”</p>

<p>“And I too. What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Make mayonnaise for the sandwiches.</p>

<p>“Put on the soup, Marta, and the vegetables in it as
I told you yesterday.”</p>

<p>The lobster was now cool, and Molly began to prepare
it. She took off the claws, split it down the back,
then called Marta to watch as she removed the entrail
that runs through the tail. “In the head is found a
small bladder or bag which must be taken out; it is
sometimes called the ‘lady;’ and along each side, under
the shell, will be found bits of a drab-colored spongy
substance called the ‘lady’s fingers;’ they are at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
root of the small claws; when these are removed, all
the rest of the lobster is good. This soft, greenish fat
might seem to you should be thrown away, but it is,
many think, the best part of the lobster.”</p>

<p>The claws were then cracked and the meat taken out.
Molly then made a pint of white sauce and divided it
into two parts. Into one she put the meat of the lobster
chopped fine, and seasoned it very highly with pepper
and salt, and enough lemon juice to give a perceptible
acid or piquant taste, and two tea-spoonfuls of very
finely chopped pickled cucumber.</p>

<p>To the other sauce she stirred the contents of a box
of chicken also chopped fine, and a large table-spoonful
of the mayonnaise, which was made rather more tart
than usual, and this also was seasoned highly and a tea-spoonful
of capers stirred through it. Both the lobster
and chicken were put away till time to cut sandwiches.</p>

<p>The dinner was to be oysters on the half shell and
stewed steak, as being easy and <i>British</i>.</p>

<p>The recipe was given to Marta, who, with a little
looking after, could prepare it. It was as follows:—</p>

<p>Put a table-spoonful of butter in a stew-pan; when
hot lay in a pound and a half of the tender side of round
steak floured, having removed nearly all fat. Let it
quickly brown with one onion, cut in slices; then put to
it a pint of boiling water. Draw it to the side of the
fire, where it will just simmer for two hours and a half;
then take the meat up on a hot dish, and skim the gravy
clear of fat; stir into it a dessert-spoonful of brown
thickening (see recipe, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>.), and a half can
of mushrooms, with the liquor. Let this boil fast till
there is about half a pint; season with pepper and salt,
take off the little skin of grease that fast boiling has
sent to the surface, draw it back from the fire, and lay
the steak in again; let it all just <i>keep at the boiling-point</i>,
not boil, for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Harry was to come home at five to get dinner over,
and by way of a sweet dish they were to have omelette
soufflé, or as Harry called it, <i>hot</i> ice cream; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
quickly made and required no sauce. After luncheon,
as there was nothing more to be done till the <i>consommé</i>
was ready to clear, Molly and her friend went out to
walk. At half a mile distance there was a spot where
Molly had remarked the lovely ferns and moss; they
took a basket to bring some home to dress the rooms,
and as there were few flowers, they gathered the white
plumes of the wild carrot.</p>

<p>“I think we will resist the golden-rod, graceful as it
is; every room in Greenfield has a bunch of it, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>When in the house two ginger-jars were filled with
the ferns and tall white blossoms; from one, long sprays
of honeysuckle from their own piazza were trailing,
and this was put on the little stand in the hall. The
other jar was put in the fireplace in the parlor. About
the rooms tufts of bright red geraniums were set in
specimen glasses.</p>

<p>“I think that looks quite festive,” said Mrs. Welles,
surveying the effect. “Will you have autumn leaves
for the buffet?”</p>

<p>“I confess I don’t like them in rooms, beautiful as
they are on trees; I thought of filling those tall jars
with these ferns and putting single sprays of them in
tall champagne glasses between the dishes of sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“That will be prettier.”</p>

<p>Molly had decided, as Marta would be a shy and possibly
awkward waitress, to have everything except soup
and coffee arranged prettily on the sideboard, and every
gentleman could help himself and a lady. The coffee
and <i>consommé</i> would be sent round, and a small table
had a tea-equipage arranged on it. Mrs. Welles would
steer Marta to safety, when she should start with the
waiter. It was a matter for discussion whether Marta
should be called upon at all, and she was admitted to
service simply as a pleasure to herself; Molly knew she
would be greatly disappointed if she were not allowed to
take some active part in the proceedings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are a curious girl, Molly,” Mrs. Welles had
said when she heard Molly’s reason. “It would not
have occurred to me.”</p>

<p>“Nor to me, perhaps, if I had not remembered that
this girl has no acquaintances about here, and to the
festive German nature to sit in a quiet kitchen, and
hear voices and laughter, must be infinitely more dull
than making herself useful and seeing the faces of those
who laugh and talk. I can see she is quite excited by
the thought of numbers of people.”</p>

<p>The sideboard was moved into the pantry off the dining-room;
two Albert biscuit boxes were put, one at
each end of it, a small board (one of a set of hanging
book-shelves removed for the occasion) was placed on
them and then covered with a fine white napkin; at
each end a vase of ferns, and along it, disposed so that
the colors would show to best advantage, were the iced
cakes and macaroons. On the sideboard itself another
long white napkin was laid, and here were to be the
dishes of sandwiches; the arrangement of this beforehand
freed Molly from anxiety, and when the door of
the pantry was closed it was not seen; yet with it open
the sideboard was so placed that it and nothing else was
visible from the room. A bracket lamp was to be fastened
so as to light it up as much as the interior of the
dining-room. When the arrangements were all made,
Mrs. Welles and Molly repaired to the kitchen. The
dinner was quietly cooking and Marta had just got
through her work.</p>

<p>“I will clear the soup first, because I want you to
see it, Marta.” Molly took the two whites of eggs and
their shells left from the mayonnaise and two more;
then she beat up shells and all to a froth, mixed a small
cup of the cold soup with them, and poured the whole
into the soup, beating all the while till it was at boiling-point
again; then she drew it back from the fire
and left it ten minutes. While it settled, she put a
large mixing-bowl on the table, and a colander in that;
then an old napkin, that she had dipped into boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
water and wrung out, was laid over the colander. In
ten minutes the egg was hanging in the soup like white
curds and the soup itself looked quite clear.</p>

<p>It was poured through the cloth and allowed to drip.
Molly lifted the colander, and when the soup had run
through removed it <i>without squeezing</i>. The soup lay in
the bowl like clear weak tea. Molly added a few drops
of caramel (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>.), and then tasted it for
seasoning. The caramel only made it a shade darker
than it was, just a bright straw color. The boiling with
the vegetables had reduced it to about five quarts. Intending
it to be so reduced had caused Molly to omit
part of the salt; if salted for <i>eight</i> quarts and reduced to
<i>five</i> it would be too salt to use, as <i>salt never evaporates</i>.</p>

<p>The soup was now put into a marbleized preserving-pan,
which would give no more taste than a china
bowl, and be ready to boil up when required.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welles had, meanwhile, been cutting sandwiches,
and already had quite a pile of thin slices of bread,
which Molly now spread thinly with mayonnaise. When
two loaves were cut up, Mrs. Welles put a thin layer of
the chicken mixture on some of the slices Molly had
spread with mayonnaise; then put another slice over it,
and when a good many were done, the crust was cut off
all round and each slice cut from corner to corner, thus
making four little three-cornered sandwiches. When
there were enough of these done, they treated the lobster
in the same way, and when all were cut and arranged
on dishes a <i>damp</i> cloth was laid over them, and
they were put in a cool place till just before they were
needed. Everything was now ready. Mrs. Winfield’s
reserve cups and saucers had all been got out and
dusted; Mrs. Lennox had sent over a dozen. These
were put in readiness, with piles of small plates, napkins,
etc., on a large tray to be brought in and placed
by the sideboard when the time came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omelet Soufflé.</span>—Molly beat four whites of eggs
till they would not slip from the bowl, just before dinner,
and then the yolks of two she beat four minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
with three table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar and one
tea-spoonful of vanilla extract.</p>

<p>When Marta was ready to put the dinner on the table,
Molly turned the whites of the eggs on the yolks, and
mixed them very gently, <i>lifting</i> the yolks as it were <i>over</i>
the whites with the spoon, not stirring them; any quick
movement with whites of eggs tends to liquefy them;
then she buttered an oval dish and heaped the mixture
lightly on it, a table-spoonful at a time, piling always
towards the middle; then she sifted powdered sugar
over it, and just before she went in to dinner she put it
in the oven, which was moderately hot.</p>

<p>“It will take about ten minutes to get a golden
brown, Marta, and when you look at it be careful not to
fully open the door, for the least draught may cause it
to fall; and when it is nicely brown bring it in without
waiting for anything. I will have the table ready for
you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />

<small>GÂTEAU DE RIZ—FRENCH RICE CAKE—PREPARING
CALF’S HEAD—MOCK-TURTLE SOUP—MORE
NOODLES—PIGEON PIE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course Molly’s supper was a success, and of course
there were many who thought it must have cost a great
deal more than the amount usually expended; but when
there was a comparison of expenses there was nothing
to be said, for Molly was well within the lowest, and
then every one wanted to know how it was done, and especially
how the sandwiches were made, such a pleasant
change were they from the usual thing, good as it is.
Molly was not experienced in quantities needed, and had
feared something might fall short, but there were both
<i>consommé</i> and cakes left.</p>

<p>“Shall we have to live on ‘stale party’ the rest of
the week, Molly?” Harry had asked.</p>

<p>“You’ll have ‘stale party’ soup a couple of times, but
no other reminiscence shall be served up.”</p>

<p>And to give Marta an opportunity of showing her way
of making noodles to Mrs. Welles, Molly decided to have
noodle soup and roast beef for dinner.</p>

<p>They all three set to work to remove the traces of the
night before. While Marta swept, Molly and her friend
washed up dishes and returned them to their places.
When all was done, Molly said, “What can I make with
the spare yolks of eggs from yesterday?”</p>

<p>“How many are there?”</p>

<p>“Four,—two from the omelette soufflé and two
from clearing the soup.”</p>

<p>“Then make a French rice cake for dinner.”</p>

<p>“You make it, for I don’t know how. And now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
are here, I want to cook a calf’s head. You are fond of
it, I know, and one is too much for us alone; besides,
there are so many English ways of cooking it. I only
know one.”</p>

<p>“Get the head, and I will show you half a dozen dishes
from it. Do you want mock-turtle soup?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Then we will use half for that purpose, and the other
we will do various things with.”</p>

<p>Molly had already ordered her butcher to get one for
her one day this week. He had sent word it would
be ready this morning, and she was expecting it.</p>

<p>Calf’s head, although a fashionable dish, either as
mock-turtle or any of the several ways in which it is
served, is, like some other things with an awe-inspiring
name, a very economical one, especially in country places,
where calves’ heads have few buyers. For this reason
Molly wanted to perfect herself in preparing it. By the
time Mrs. Welles had put a small cup of rice on to boil
in a pint and a half of milk, the head came. She watched
the rice come to the boil, then put it where it would simmer
slowly, and turned her attention to the head. It
was a very good one, for Molly had said if it were not
fat she would not care to have it. She had also directed
it to be split. He had asked her if she wanted it skinned.</p>

<p>“No, indeed; only scalded and the hair scraped off.”</p>

<p>“I only asked, because some folks like them skinned.”</p>

<p>Molly was relating this to Mrs. Welles and preparing
her to see the head either skinned in spite of her order,
or else sent with the hair half on when it came, but it
was really very well dressed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let you prepare it, Charlotte, and look
on, for I have only seen it done once at a cooking-demonstration.”</p>

<p>“Very well, you attend to the rice, then, and keep it
from burning. It must stew slowly, with the cover tight
on it, till it will mash into a paste, and more milk added
if required.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Welles laid the head open on a meat-board, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
then removed the tongue and brains, being very careful
not to injure them. She laid them in a dish of water, in
which was a small cup of vinegar, until they were needed
for use; then she took out the membrane of the nasal
passages and washed the head in salt and water. This
done, she put the head in a pot and covered it with six
quarts of cold water. It was to boil very slowly two
hours. Into the water she put a large carrot, a turnip,
and an onion, with six sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves,
half a tea-spoonful of marjoram and the same of thyme
(these herbs were tied up in a bit of muslin), and a
small table-spoonful of salt, with half a tea-spoonful of
pepper.</p>

<p>By the time this was done the rice was cooked thoroughly,
and it was as stiff as could be stirred and turned
out into a bowl, when it was sweetened, a tiny pinch
of salt put into it, a large tea-spoonful of vanilla extract,
and the grated rind of a lemon; and when a little cool,
the beaten yolks of eggs, and all was stirred together. It
was now about the consistence of stiff mush. A square
shallow pan was thickly buttered, and strewed with bread
crumbs, and the rice put into it. The pan used was a
small-sized dripping-pan, and the rice formed a layer
an inch and a half deep. It was made very smooth over
the top, and then a little butter was oiled and poured on
it; the pan was then so moved that the butter ran over
the rice in every direction; sugar was then sifted all
over it a quarter of an inch deep, and the whole was put
in the oven to bake till a fine brown.</p>

<p>“If you want that to be extra fine, Molly, at any time,
chop a cup of almonds quite fine, and strew them over
with the sugar. When it is baked, let it get cold in the
pan, then turn it out and cut it into strips or tablets an
inch broad and two or three in length. They should be
put on a dish in the ice-box before serving, to be ice
cold.”</p>

<p>When the calf’s head had been boiling very slowly
two hours, it was taken carefully from the water and one
half of it was laid aside; the other half was to be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
dinner. This was wiped, the inside bones carefully
taken out, and it was closely scored through the outer
skin; then it was washed over with a beaten egg and
thickly covered with fine bread crumbs, in a cup of which
half a tea-spoonful of salt, half a salt-spoonful of pepper,
a tea-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, and the third of
one of thyme or savory, had been thoroughly mixed. This
was to be basted with butter melted in a cup until all
the crumbs were moistened, and then baked till brown.
If the crumbed surface looked dry in the oven, it must
be again basted. This was to be garnished with little
rolls of bacon, made by cutting thinnest slices, trimmed
from rind and smoke, rolled round the finger, and laid
on a tin in a quick oven till clear and crisp, but not overdone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welles got everything ready early, put the half
head on the dish ready to go into the oven at five o’clock,
cut the bacon, and told Molly what the gravy was to be,
so that she might make it while she herself went on with
mock-turtle soup, which was for next day’s (Sunday)
dinner.</p>

<p>“You can have almost any sauce; English sauce
piquante is very nice, or brown mushroom sauce.”</p>

<p>“What is English sauce piquante?”</p>

<p>“I call it so, although the old-fashioned name for it is
<i>Wow Wow</i> sauce.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try it, if you like it.”</p>

<p>“I do. This is the recipe: Chop fine a dessert-spoonful
of capers, the same of parsley, and one large pickled
walnut or two small. Put a table-spoonful of flour and
one of butter to get brown together in a saucepan; put
to them, stirring all the time, half a pint of stock or the
broth you have—that in which the head was boiled
will do; when it boils, mix a tea-spoonful of dry mustard
with a table-spoonful of wine, half one of vinegar,
and a tea-spoonful of red currant or cranberry jelly, and
one of Worcestershire sauce. Let all simmer till of a
creamy thickness, season to taste, and last add the capers
and pickles. It is a convenient sauce, because you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
vary the flavor as you like, putting pickled cucumber instead
of walnut or capers, any other store sauce instead
of Worcestershire, and cider in place of wine, and if you
have no jelly, a lump of sugar. The characteristic of the
sauce is to be a very little sour, a very little sweet, and a
little hot, with an agreeable flavor beside.”</p>

<p>The bones that had been taken from the part of the
head that was to bake were put back in the pot, the meat
was cut from the other half in neat pieces and laid between
two dishes to keep it flat, and all the liquor that
ran from it, with the rest of the bones, was put back to
boil with the liquor till it was reduced to three quarts.</p>

<p>“Now, Molly, as it is impossible to tell how strong or
weak dried herbs are, and mock-turtle is a highly flavored
soup, I am going to adopt the plan of making essence of
the herbs and use just enough.”</p>

<p>So saying, she put into a little saucepan two tea-spoonfuls
of chopped parsley, three quarters of one of marjoram,
three quarters of one of savory and the same of
lemon thyme, and a bay leaf and a half.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll put these to boil, closely covered, in half a
pint of water for twenty minutes, then squeeze out as
much of the goodness as I can, and add this herb juice
to the soup, little by little, till we get the right flavor.”</p>

<p>As the soup was more than sufficient to serve for two
dinners, it was decided to flavor it all, then divide it, and
have one half thick mock-turtle, the other clear. The
thick was for Sunday’s dinner, as Mr. Welles, who was
coming to dinner, was particularly fond of it. While
the soup was boiling down Mrs. Welles prepared egg
balls to serve with it, Molly made some rough puff paste
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.) for pigeon pie, and when that was
done Marta was ready to make noodles.</p>

<p>The egg balls were made as follows: Two eggs boiled
hard, the yolks pounded with a half tea-spoonful of finely
chopped parsley, half a salt-spoonful of salt, a scant
quarter one of <i>white</i> pepper, made into stiff paste with
raw yolk of egg, and moulded into balls, size of marbles.
Each ball was rolled in white of egg beaten a little;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
when well coated they were dipped in flour and dropped
into boiling water for two minutes. These were part
to be served in the thick soup next day, the rest left
for the clear mock-turtle.</p>

<p>Marta used one egg for the noodles, a pinch of salt,
and flour enough to make part of it into a smooth paste
about as large as a small egg; this she worked smooth and
laid aside; to the rest she added more flour, and did <i>not
work into a smooth paste</i>, but into a rough, crumbly sort
of ball; this, she explained, was for the quickest made
and most generally used noodles, in the part of Germany
she came from. She took a coarse grater and grated
the rough ball into coarse crumbs that looked like yellow
tapioca; these could be dried carefully in a very
cool oven, and used whenever wanted. Then she took
the smooth ball she had made, and asked Molly whether
she would like her to make the ribbon noodles as before
(see recipe, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV">Chapter XXV</a>.), or another sort.</p>

<p>“Oh, another, by all means!”</p>

<p>She then grated on the smooth ball of paste just a
suspicion of nutmeg, put the least bit of butter on her
hand,—a bit as large as a small hazel nut,—and rolled
the ball and worked it over till the nutmeg and butter
were in it; then she cut the paste into pieces as large as
a hazel nut, made each into olive shapes, and they were
finished.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Marta, we will have those in our soup
to-night. I think I remember eating them in Germany.”</p>

<p>Molly had already prepared a pair of pigeons. She
now put on to stew very slowly, with half a pint of
water, a pound of juicy round steak, for the pigeon pie,
which she intended to make next day. When the steak
had simmered an hour and a half, it was taken up and
put away. The calf’s tongue was parboiled, to be used
on Monday.</p>

<p>The next morning Molly made the pie directly after
breakfast. Laying the steak, cut into finger-lengths, at
the bottom of a deep oval dish, the birds were divided
into halves, and both steak and pigeons seasoned highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
with pepper and salt. The birds were laid over the
steak, placing them so that the pie would be dome-shaped
when covered; two eggs were hard boiled and cut in
four and the pieces laid among the meat; then a <i>small</i>
half cup of water was poured in; the gravy from the
steak was left to pour in hot when the pie was cooked.
The pie was then finished in the same way as the veal
and ham pie (see recipe <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Chapter XXXII</a>.), except that
the feet of the two birds were put in boiling water for a
moment, the skin rubbed off them, leaving them a bright
crimson, and a slit was made at each end of the groove
that went round the pie, and two of the little feet put in
each, the claws outwards.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welles gave Marta the pieces of calf’s head that
were to go into the soup, told her to put them in half an
hour before dinner, let them simmer, and just before
serving she was to put into the quart, which was all that
was to be made hot, a table-spoonful of brown thickening,
a glass of wine, and the juice of half a lemon, with half
the egg balls. The pigeon pie would need an hour to
bake, and was to be kept in a very cold place until
twelve.</p>

TONGUE—BRAINS, AU BEURRE NOIR (BROWN
BUTTER)—CALF’S HEAD—HOLLANDAISE
SAUCE—CALF’S HEAD EN TORTUE.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Molly</span>, what are you going to do with all that beef
from <i>consommé?</i>” asked Mrs. Welles, on the Monday
after the reception.</p>

<p>“I have usually made hash of it and given it to a family
who need all the help they can get; but there is so much,
I am inclined to try an experiment. Would not part do
to make an imitation of that mock brawn that is so good
in London? What is the recipe?”</p>

<p>“That is made with new beef and pork, but if the jelly
can be supplied, it would be very nice and savory treated
exactly as if it were new meat.”</p>

<p>“So I thought, and I got from the butcher the day I
bought the beef two hocks of pork. It’s early for pork,
but he assured me this was killed right on a farm here,
and I could see it was really good, although I must say I
think November early enough, as a rule, for pork.”</p>

<p>“It’s a little different when you buy it in that way.
What are you going to do with the feet, or ‘hocks’ as
you call them?”</p>

<p>“They have been cleaned and laid in salt; to-morrow
they will be salt enough. I think of boiling them till
the bones slip out, cutting the flesh in small bits, and putting
the bones back into the water and boiling till there
is no more goodness in them; but as the beef is over-cooked,
I don’t want the pork to be so; then strain the
liquor, which will be solid jelly when cold. I think two
quarts and a pint of water may be put on the hocks,—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
will leave rather less than two quarts when boiled
slowly for three hours with the lid on,—then I shall
choose the firmest pieces of the beef, cut them into large
dice, and put them into the liquor with the pork; but I
want you to give me the seasoning of the regular recipe,
if you brought it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; as you wrote you wanted some English pickling
and curing recipes, I brought my little book; but
I advise you to remember the difference in climate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do; but I know a family who have the most
delicious bacon and ham, and they use old country recipes
in curing.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I came supplied.” She took from
her pocket a note-book. “The seasoning for mock
brawn is as follows: Two tea-spoonfuls of salt, one of
ground allspice, one of black pepper, one of sugar, half
a tea-spoonful of marjoram dried and rubbed fine, half
one of thyme.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll use sage instead of thyme, and I fancy
it will prove a very savory dish to eat cold.”</p>

<p>Of the calf’s head there was still the tongue, the
brains, nearly two quarts of clear mock-turtle soup, a
small platter of the pieces of the head boiled, and some
of the baked head.</p>

<p>“It’s rather an absurd joint to buy for such a small
family as ours, unless one is prepared to eat it in every
form for three days.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will keep a few days, but the brains and
tongue must be used soon, as they spoil easily. Suppose
you have stewed tongue for dinner to-day, with
brains and brown butter? The rest of the head and
soup can be left for a day or two this weather, and I
will prepare them at once.”</p>

<p>They went to the kitchen together, and Mrs. Welles
began by taking the skin off the tongue, which had been
parboiled on Saturday; then she trimmed it neatly and
cut little strips of salt pork, parallel with the rind, as
thick as a match, and larded it; then she put into a small
stone pot that had a cover two slices of fat pork, a tea-spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of chopped parsley, half an onion, a bay leaf,
a salt-spoonful of salt, half one of pepper, and half a
tea-spoonful of thyme. She sprinkled the tongue with
salt and pepper, laid it in the jar, and round it cut a
carrot in slices; over this she poured a cup of soup and
covered it close. It was to bake three hours and a
half. When done it was to be taken up and the gravy
strained and skimmed; the tongue was to be laid in a
dish, with green peas round it, and the gravy poured
over it.</p>

<p>She also cleaned the calf’s brains, carefully removing
all the slime and fibrous skin, but without breaking them;
then she told Marta to put them, half an hour before
dinner, into well-salted water in which was a small bunch
of parsley and a bay leaf, to boil for twenty minutes;
then she was to have ready some fried circles of bread,
the size of a tea-cup and half an inch thick. (See <i>frying</i>,
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>.) When the brains were done they
were to be taken up and divided, and a neat piece put
on each round of bread, and on the centre of each a
small piece of pickled gherkin or red beet, and then
they were to have poured over them brown butter, made
as follows: One table-spoonful of butter melted in a little
saucepan till it was a pale brown (not the least
burnt), then a tea-spoonful of lemon juice and the same
of finely chopped parsley was to be put in it. She
warned her if the butter should get the least bit too
dark it would be spoilt, and it would darken even in
carrying from the range to the table, therefore to remove
it as soon as the color <i>began</i> to change.</p>

<p>The following were the ways in which the remains of
the head were disposed of. Though Molly was tired
of it by the time it was gone, Harry was not, and she
could not but recommend it to Mrs. Lennox as an economical
dish to have for a large family, provided she
bought only a large fleshy head; a bony one is not worth
the trouble of cooking.</p>

<p>The pieces already boiled in the soup made two small
<i>entrées</i> for Wednesday and Thursday; the first was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
simply some pieces simmered half an hour in a very little
of the soup, then taken up and a Hollandaise sauce
poured over it. (See recipe, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX">Chapter XXIX</a>.) The
second was the quite celebrated one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calf’s Head en Tortue</span>, made as follows: A
table-spoonful of butter was melted in a saucepan, a
table-spoonful of flour mixed with it and allowed to bubble;
then a cup of the clear soup reserved for the purpose
was put to it and stirred, to make a thick, smooth
sauce; the juice of a large tomato (Molly used a little
pulp of canned tomato, as the season was over) was
strained to it, and the liquor from half a can of mushrooms
and a dozen of the mushrooms; the pieces of
meat were laid in this sauce and stewed for twenty minutes
very gently, with great care that they might not
burn. While this was cooking, a small saucepan was
put on, half full of fat, and made <i>very hot;</i> then one egg
for each person was broken into separate cups; these
were dropped one at a time into the smoking fat, just as if
it were water, and they were to be poached; one minute
was enough to brown each one, and <i>only one was done
at a time</i>, or while one was taken out the other would
harden in the intense heat of the fat. The eggs were
perfectly round and brown. They were laid round the
dish of meat, and between them tiny green gherkins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />

<small>IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lennox</span> came in to call on Mrs. Welles later the
same day. Her Maggie had been with her now several
days, and she could judge how far she was likely to be
of use to her. Molly had been anxious to know the result
of the experiment, for she felt deeply interested in
her neighbor, and that if Maggie should prove more a
trial than comfort she might perhaps have contributed
by her advice to that result. After a little conversation
about Mrs. Welles’s visit and her long acquaintance with
Molly, the latter asked how she got on with the new inmate.</p>

<p>“For the first three or four days it seemed a failure,
but I am hopeful now of better things; she is strong,
seems willing, and I think is trying to do. At all events
I almost think if she never gets beyond the point of
washing dishes, taking up ashes, making fires, preparing
vegetables and washing I shall be the gainer, for that
drudgery left me no time for the lighter work to be
properly done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but if she does those things willingly, and as
you tell her, she will not stop there, I think; Mrs.
Framley was speaking of her sister, and says she is of
thoroughly good stock, and that is a great deal. The
good-for-nothing girls one meets with usually come from
thriftless stock.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to hope for the best, and as I’m not
expecting too many of the cardinal virtues for a few dollars
a month, perhaps I may not be disappointed; and
now, my dear Mrs. Bishop, I am going to ask you to give
me a few recipes of economical dishes for a family like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
ours. Until I talked with you, I only knew of pot-pie
and Irish stew, both badly made, and though I have a
cookery-book which you tell me is excellent, I never
made anything come quite right out of it.”</p>

<p>“In justice to the cooking-book, and indeed to latter
day cooking-books in general, I think, perhaps, if you’ll
forgive me, that may have been because you did not
know enough of the elements of cooking.”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not, and although I know little now,
I feel so very much wiser than I did a month ago that
I look back in wonder. There’s another reason why
I could not use my cookery-book,—it always wanted
something I had not in the house by way of flavoring;
then I shut up the book and cooked in my own old way.”</p>

<p>“One of your American worthies, ‘Josiah Allen’s wife,’
I think, says: ‘It’s the flavorin’ as does it,’” said Mrs.
Welles; “and I think fifty cents expended in flavorings a
very good investment, from an economical point of view.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if one lives in New York one can buy all sorts
of sweet herbs, and dry them. At the same time I
don’t think Mr. Lennox likes them.”</p>

<p>“I have known many people who thought they did
not like them because they had never had them properly
used, or at least when properly used they enjoyed the
dish without knowing that it contained herbs at all; in
the same way I have known people who used Worcestershire
sauce in everything, and who would even ruin clear
soup by pouring it in, vow and protest they could never
touch anything that had the faintest suspicion of garlic;
Worcestershire sauce has more than a suspicion of garlic.
I know others who will eat no pickles but Crosse &amp;
Blackwell’s, which likewise owe the subtle difference between
them and all others equally to the effect of garlic;
so carefully used however that only by making pickles
with and without that suspicion of the malodorous herb
can you see why many other pickles lack ‘just something.’”</p>

<p>“Well—I’m willing to be instructed, so willing that
if I’d time and money I would go to New York and go
through a course at a cooking-school.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! If every young wife did that, what years of
work and vexation she would save herself; it is such
up-hill work teaching one’s self from books; it’s like
trying to play a piece of music without having learned
to count time; after months, if you knew the notes, you
might, by your ear, make something out of it; but think
of the toil! So it is with recipes,—without the key,
how can any one cook? to be told what goes into a pot,
and to ‘stew it gently’ so long, and you don’t know
what gentle stewing is! You are told to put your meat
in the oven and bake it ‘beautifully brown,’ and you
don’t know that to brown beautifully your oven must be
just so hot when it goes in, and that if you have water
in your pan, it will steam, not bake; and so on.”</p>

<p>Molly smiled; Mrs. Welles was on her hobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all true, and I only wish I had the first
year of my married life to go over again, before a family
came in the way of my doing what I would like.”</p>

<p>“To revert to the question of flavorings,” put in
Molly. “I found all I wanted at the grocery; they
put up sweet herbs of all kinds now very nicely, in paper
boxes, a box of thyme <i>leaves</i> (be sure and get the
<i>leaves</i> rather than the powdered herb) or marjoram
leaves cost but five cents each. Now while parsley is so
plentiful and cheap I shall buy ten cents’ worth and dry
it for winter.”</p>

<p>“I did not know parsley would dry and retain its flavor.”</p>

<p>“It will not if done as we dry other herbs; it must be
quickly done by heat; if put in a cool oven with the door
open, or in a plate-warmer, it will dry in a few hours; then
it can be rubbed fine and put in a tin box. I think a box
of lemon thyme, one of savory, one of marjoram, one of
sage, with five cents’ worth of bay leaves,—twenty cents
in all,—will give you all the herb flavorings generally
called for, and last a year if you like them as sparingly
used as I should use them. Spices most people have, I
would almost say ‘unluckily,’ remembering how sadly too
much spice mars much of our American cooking; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
will give you several recipes, and if you have difficulty
with them let me know. I think perhaps when the cold
weather comes in we might do a little economy together.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By buying meat in large quantities, beef by the
quarter, mutton by the half sheep; my family is too
small to make such a way of buying wise, but you have
several mouths to feed, and none would go to waste.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox looked dubious and said:</p>

<p>“I used to think about it. Mr. Lennox suggested he
should buy a quarter of beef, as he knew some one who
did so all through the winter and found it profitable,
but a lady who had also tried the plan told me there was
no profit in it, for there was so much waste,—so much
coarse meat that she could make no use of.”</p>

<p>“In that case there would be no real economy, but
there need be no waste, and should be none, and no one
need eat coarse food. I mean, properly prepared no
part of beef need be coarse; if a piece of brisket or flank
were served up as a roast, or the leg broiled, that would
indeed be coarse; but each cooked in its appropriate way,
they would be far from being so.”</p>

<p>“But the fat,—there is so much of it!”</p>

<p>“But what more useful than beef fat, or more wholesome?
It is next to butter, I think.”</p>

<p>“That is true; but my friend, I know, could not use
it, and said she was so thankful to see the last of that
beef.”</p>

<p>“The only objection usually urged against it, and I
think a very reasonable one, is that the family must eat
beef or mutton, whichever is in the house, constantly till
it is gone; but I do not see even that necessity, for in
cold weather the meat will keep so well that some
change can be had, and then in winter, even for my
small use, I would not fear to buy half a sheep; I could
make it keep a month, unless the weather broke; then
I would manage to preserve it; but if <i>I</i> had mutton
and you had beef, we could certainly change sometimes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
though half a sheep used during a month would not
necessitate monotony, for one could have many things
between.”</p>

<p>“What would you do with mutton fat?”</p>

<p>“That, I grant, is not so available; but there is less
of it, and I should try it out and make soup. The
actual saving is considerable, especially in mutton. It
is rare to get chops under twenty cents a pound; leg
fourteen, if you buy them separately, which is the frequent
way, while the half sheep can be bought in Washington
Market for ten or eleven cents a pound; the latter
is an outside price (a butcher would buy for less)
for prime mutton, while beef hind quarter would be for
buyers like ourselves thirteen or fourteen cents a pound,
unless there is some temporary rise in the market, when
of course one need not buy; but that is the average
price in New York.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all this?” asked Mrs. Lennox
in amazement. “I mean, how do you know what the
prices are now?”</p>

<p>Molly laughed. “In this particular instance I made
special inquiry or asked Mrs. Welles to do so; but I
keep pretty well up in such matters by the Saturday
editions of some of the evening papers, although I usually
add a couple of cents a pound to the quotations for
prime meats to allow for any difference there may be.
I do it, however, only from curiosity, for I could not buy
my own meat so, even if my family were large, for Mr.
Bishop is not experienced enough to buy and send it
out.”</p>

<p>“Nor is Mr. Lennox, but he has a friend who has
bought so for years, and who also, when game and
poultry are cheap, and I believe they often are as cheap
as meat, sends that home to his wife too; and Mr. Lennox
enjoys going with him, and once in a while has sent
us home turkeys when they have been very low in price.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll write out several
recipes to use up the parts of the beef that you will
not broil or roast, so that you will not be forced to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
beef exclusively in order to get rid of it before it spoils.
I will do the same with the mutton.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Mrs. Bishop, how can I possibly
trouble you so far? What can I do for you in return?”</p>

<p>“I know something you can easily do. Let me have
part of your beef or mutton when you get it; we’ll take
turns about the prime parts,—I have as much use for
coarse ones sometimes; and ask Mr. Lennox once in
a while when he is buying meat with his friend and
game is cheap, to send me out some. In New York
prairie hens and partridges are sometimes a dollar a
pair; then they are cheaper than meat to those fond of
them as we are. Yet Mrs. Framley says she never
knew them less than two dollars a pair here. Then the
writing will not be much trouble to me, for while Mrs.
Welles is here I intend to get some recipes from her;
the one copy will do for both of us.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m getting all the good of that arrangement.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s a case of give and take between us. You
learn cooking from me, I learn something as valuable
from you.”</p>

<p>“You are kind enough to say so.”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Lennox had gone, Mrs. Welles asked what
Molly meant by saying she was learning something just
as valuable.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lennox has the best-trained children I ever
knew. They are full of fun and frolic, yet cheerfully
obedient to her, and as the subject is likely to interest
me, I have observed them very closely, and asked her
whether they were unusually amiable or whether it was
due to training. She told me she did not do much
training, nor were the children specially amiable; and it
is true there seems less <i>small</i> restriction in her family
than in most others where the children are ‘regular
pickles.’”</p>

<p>“How does she manage them?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think she knows herself. She says she
makes few rules, and those the children hardly know of;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
they only know there are a few things they dare not do;
but I notice they never ask her for a thing twice, and
that is because she says she never denied anything she
knew she might be induced to grant; so they know
pleading or worrying is thrown away, and four happier
children you never saw. I asked her once if her babies
were as good as they are when older. She said two
were no trouble; her first was a restless one for the
first three months and the last was sick; but she will
not believe that well babies would be cross or restless if
properly managed, and she gave me her experience with
the first one. Of course I know nothing from experience;
I can only observe and read and think, and I, too,
hope to have a good baby if it is a well one.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I should not have thought Mrs. Lennox
was a woman to have strongly-formed ideas on the subject.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe she thinks so herself. I don’t
even know that she has formulated her ideas. She
may have acted only on instinct, but the result is charming;
if you were to see her children you would say so.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br />

<small>ENGLISH MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS—PICKLING AND
CURING—ROAST BEEF-HEART—SOUSED MACKEREL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Welles’s</span> visit was to have been a week only;
but at the end of it it seemed as if they had but just got
to the point of enjoying each other, and Mr. Welles was
induced to spare her for a few days longer.</p>

<p>“I declare, Molly, when I came here I expected to do
so much, both for you and myself, and I’ve done nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; just consider my entertainment, what you
did to help me in that; but there’s one thing I want
this very day, that is, English muffins and crumpets. I
have tried once or twice from recipes in my English
cook-books, but they always give the quantities for a
bakery,—a peck of flour, sometimes a bushel,—and it
is difficult to reduce to my small needs; besides, I know
success depends on consistency, and there is very little
guidance given. ‘Water to make a soft dough’ is only
stated; <i>how</i> soft is not hinted, and the so-called English
muffins in our books are very good as muffins, only they
don’t happen to be the thing at all.”</p>

<p>“I know it is really only a question of consistency. I
will make some this very day, if you have yeast in the
house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am especially anxious to have them, because
they are as good two days old as one, and in a little family
like ours that is a great thing.”</p>

<p>It was Monday, and by the time the muffins had risen,
washing would be over and the top of the fire free.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out and set them now.”</p>

<p>The setting was very simple, being only the making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of a stiff bread-sponge. Half a cake of yeast was dissolved
in a pint and a half of warm milk, into which a
scant tea-spoonful of salt, two of sugar and one large
one of butter warmed, were stirred. Into this as much
dry, sifted flour was mixed (<i>about</i> three pints) as would
make an exceedingly stiff batter, in fact “stiffer than
batter, softer than dough” may serve as an indication of
the consistency, or “<i>almost</i> too stiff to stir, <i>quite</i> too soft
to knead.” When this was beaten long and hard, one
third was put into another bowl and this was thinned
down with warm milk to a batter that would pour
slowly. This was for crumpets, the only difference between
the two being in consistency. They were covered
and put behind the range to rise.</p>

<p>“Now let me have your book, Charlotte; I have the
time, and will copy out what I want; but first give me a
recipe for cooking beef heart. I remember what a good
dish it was, and they are only ten or fifteen cents each,
and there must be at least two pounds of solid meat in
one.”</p>

<p>“There is; the only objection is the quickness with
which heart chills, and the taste of cold suet is very disagreeable.
This may be obviated by careful preparation,
however; here is the recipe:</p>

<p>“Cut off the gristle and the ‘deaf ear,’ as the tough
red lobe at the top is called, if the butcher has not done
it, and trim off all the fat as closely as possible; then lay
the heart in boiling water for half an hour, keeping it
just simmering. When thus parboiled, dry it well and
fill the three holes with nice stuffing, either sage, onion
and bread crumbs made with equal proportions of boiled
onions and crumbs, and chopped with ten large sage
leaves to the pint, which must be dried till they powder,
or highly seasoned veal-stuffing made as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Veal-Stuffing.</span>—Two ounces of beef suet,
chopped very fine, four ounces of bread crumbs, one
table-spoonful of chopped parsley, and half one each of
thyme and marjoram, and the juice of half a lemon,
half a tea-spoonful of salt, a pinch of pepper and a suspicion
of nutmeg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fill the heart full of whichever of these stuffings is
preferred, but do not press it in tight. Skewer over the
top several thin slices of fat pork, dredge it with flour,
and bake it one hour and a half in a good oven. Make
gravy of a cup of good soup or broth, poured into the
pan in which the heart was baked, and thickened with a
tea-spoonful of brown thickening. Many people like
red currant jelly made hot and served with it as sauce.
The platter and plates must be very hot and the heart
covered as it goes to table.</p>

<p>“The next day it can be warmed over by cutting it
into slices and gently stewing it in a rich gravy. It is
nicer than venison thus prepared.”</p>

<p>When Molly had this written in her book she opened
the one Mrs. Welles handed to her and, to select from
the many there, read, before copying, the recipes that
would be most useful to herself and Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p>“I see you have preliminary remarks which will be
valuable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my mother’s experience, not my own; but she
was a North-of-England woman and thought the London
cured meat not worth eating.”</p>

<p>Under the head of <i>general rules</i> Molly read:</p>

<p>Avoid salting meat in hot weather; from October
to April is the right season. If forced to do it, however,
cut it up and sprinkle it with salt before the animal heat
leaves it. If hung even for an hour, there is danger
from flies.</p>

<p>In cool weather, meat should hang three or four days
to get tender before eating, but be very careful it does
not become frost-bitten. In very cold weather, make
the salt hot before using it.</p>

<p>The great art in salting meat is to turn it every day
carefully, rubbing salt under every flap or double part,
and filling all holes with salt wherever a kernel has
been cut out, or a skewer has been in.</p>

<p>Use as little salt as will preserve the meat, as it will
leave it more juicy and tender. Two ounces of bay salt,
two of coarse sugar, and three quarters of a pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
common salt is a good proportion, and is enough for ten
or twelve pounds of meat. Do not put on all the salt at
once; have it rolled and dried, and use half the first
day, and the remainder two or three days after. Then
the blood from the first salting must be drained off.
Sugar preserves meat as well as salt; hence its use, for
it renders less salt necessary, and meat is more tender
with it. Saltpetre is only useful for reddening meat,
but is apt to harden it; if wanted red, however, take
half an ounce of saltpetre and one of coarse sugar; this
must be rubbed in the third day after the first slight salting;
the common and bay salt the next day.</p>

<p>A small piece—eight or ten pounds—of pork or
beef will require six or seven days; a large piece may
be allowed a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pickling meat.</span>—Many prefer to boil the meat in
water, instead of rubbing dry salt in. The proportions
of this pickle are, two gallons of water, three pounds
of salt, half a pound of coarse brown sugar, two ounces
of saltpetre. Boil together and skim very well while
boiling. Let it become quite cold before putting in the
meat, which must be carefully wiped from slime or blood
and any pipes or kernels removed.</p>

<p>All meat, while salting, should be kept closely covered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dutch beef.</span>—Get a fine piece of round of beef;
rub it well with one pound of coarse sugar. Do this
twice a day for three days, using same sugar. When
the sugar has thoroughly penetrated the meat, wipe dry,
and salt with the following mixture: Common and bay
salt, of each four ounces; saltpetre and sal prunel, of
each two ounces; black pepper and allspice, of each one
ounce. Rub well and continue to do so for a fortnight,
then roll the beef tight in a cloth, sew it up, and it is
ready for smoking. The smoking should be long enough
to thoroughly and slowly dry the meat, but not long
enough for the covering to separate.</p>

<p>This beef may be cut and boiled as wanted. It should
be pressed with a weight till cold. This will keep two
or three months after it is boiled, if it is rubbed all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with hot fat (lard or suet melted), and a layer of fat put
over a fresh-cut surface. This is delicious if a piece is
cut off, put to dry slowly, and grated for sandwiches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mutton hams.</span>—Coarse sugar, bay salt, and common
salt, equal parts, and to each pound of this mixture
add, of saltpetre and sal prunel, one ounce each, of black
pepper, allspice, juniper berries, and coriander seeds, all
bruised, half an ounce each. Dry them all before the
fire, and rub into the meat while hot. This is an excellent
pickle for tongues. Smoke as any other ham.
Mutton hams are usually fried or broiled in rashers, or
<i>thin</i> slices as you would pork ham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worcestershire sausages.</span>—These are made entirely
of beef. Choose a fine, juicy round steak; chop
it extremely fine. Allow two parts lean, one part fat,
and one part bread crumbs; season pretty high with pepper
and salt (and allspice if liked). Allow to each
pound eight sage leaves, dried and rubbed fine, with half
a salt-spoonful of knotted marjoram. Put them in
skins if you can, and cook as any other sausage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red beef for slicing cold.</span>—The best part for
this purpose is the thin flank. Take off the skinny inside,
and salt the meat for a week or ten days with the
following mixture rubbed in and turned morning and
night: Common salt, one pound; saltpetre and bay salt,
each one ounce; coarse brown sugar, a quarter of a
pound. Pound and mix, using of the mixture more or
less according to the size of the meat. When salt
enough, wipe the meat dry; sprinkle over it black pepper,
a little powdered mace and cloves, an onion chopped
fine and some parsley. Roll it up, bind it tight with a
strip of muslin, and boil it slowly three hours, or longer
if large. Press with a heavy weight without removing
the band. When cold remove the band and cut in very
thin slices as required.</p>

<p>“Well, I think now if Mrs. Lennox and I get meat in
large quantities this winter, we shall not need to let any
of it spoil for lack of ways to keep it,” said Molly, as
she prepared to copy the recipes she had read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; but remember that mutton will keep for six
weeks in cold, dry weather, even when not frozen, if it is
well floured and a little ginger is put in the crevices. If
it freezes and then thaws, it will generally need cooking,
but the longer you can keep it the better it will be, so
that it does not taint. The outer skin may even get
mouldy, but you will only scrape the skin and trim it.
If very mouldy and likely to give a taste, plunge it, after
scraping, into boiling water; dry it thoroughly and bake
in a very sharp oven. But all meat for keeping must
<i>hang</i>, not <i>lie</i>, and hang in a current of <i>pure</i> air.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the hint. What is this? Soused
mackerel?” She had turned to the end of the note-book
as she spoke. “I remember eating them at your house,
and how good they were; that recipe also is going down
in my book.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soused mackerel.</span>—Clean, but do not split, four
or six fresh mackerel; boil them in water just to cover, in
which are one clove, three allspice, one tea-spoonful of
salt and a quarter one of pepper to each fish. Take the
fish out as soon as done, and before they break lay them
in a deep dish. Boil the water in which they were
cooked down to half; put to it an equal quantity of vinegar
(unless the latter is very strong, when one-third
will do), and pour it over the fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soused mackerel another way</span>—“and that is
the way I like best,” said Mrs. Welles, and Molly read:
Put three or four mackerel in an earthen dish, sprinkle
over each mackerel a small tea-spoonful of salt, a sixth
of pepper, and allow to each two allspice and half a
blade of mace and half a bay leaf; mix vinegar and
water in equal proportion, and pour enough over to
cover the fish; put them in a very slow oven for three
or four hours. By that time the liquor will have diminished
until there is only enough to serve with the
fish. These fish will keep for several weeks in cold
weather. If the vinegar is very strong, use less in proportion.</p>

<p>After luncheon, Mrs. Welles went to look at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
muffins. They were hardly light, but the crumpets
were so nearly ready that she put on the griddle.</p>

<p>“You happen to have a soap-stone griddle! that is
the very thing needed for muffins, though one can manage
to bake on an iron one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am promising myself inodorous buckwheat
cakes this winter with that.”</p>

<p>It took the griddle half an hour to get thoroughly
hot.</p>

<p>“Of course you have no crumpet-rings?”</p>

<p>“No; but if these are a success I shall get a few
made; meanwhile, won’t muffin rings do? They are the
large, old-fashioned sort.”</p>

<p>“We must make them do; but I can’t bear anything
not to look <i>just</i> right. I never fancy they eat well if
they do not.” Molly handed out a bundle of large old
rings which Mrs. Welles greased and laid on the griddle;
then, when they were hot, she poured into each
batter to the depth of a quarter of an inch, drawing the
griddle a little back as she did so. She did not attempt
to turn them until the top was full of holes and the batter
had dried; then they were turned for about three
minutes; except that they were more slowly cooked, the
baking was the same as for what are usually called
raised muffins, and they appeared the same, but not quite
so thick. They should not be more than half an inch
thick when cooked. When they were done the muffins
were ready to bake; the paste was like honeycomb.</p>

<p>“Now the whole difficulty with these is shaping them,
and it requires practice. I don’t know that I shall manage
it; for it is years since I made them.”</p>

<p>The pastry-board was put on the table, a good deal of
flour spread on it, and the paste turned out very gently.</p>

<p>“You see, Molly, that the griddle is hot, yet not too
hot.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she lightly cut off bits of the soft dough
about the size of a duck’s egg. She could not touch
them easily, for they were too soft, but they were rolled
about in the flour (taking care not to press them), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was not worked into them, and they were left in a sort
of bed of it. When half a dozen were done, she took
one up very gingerly, tossing it gently back and forth
between her floured hands, to get rid of the superfluous
flour, and also because she could not let them remain in
one position for fear of their sticking to her hands, yet
so carefully as not to press the lightness out. When she
reached the griddle she lightly dropped the muffin in as
round a form as possible on it. When half a dozen
were put on in the same way, they were left to swell
and get round and dry-looking, before the griddle was
put forward to give them a slight browning. When the
top looked no longer raw, they were gently turned and
left five minutes the other side. The baking took about
twenty minutes, and they were over an inch thick when
done.</p>

<p>“I know one thing,—if <i>I</i> make these, I will have
rings made four inches in diameter expressly for English
muffins, although I know the real ones are baked without
rings. It can’t make much difference to the quality,
and will save much trouble to unpracticed hands.”</p>

<p>“I think so too.”</p>

<p>There were a great many more muffins and crumpets
than were likely to be used in their small family, and
Molly said she should send some to Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p>“Then pray send the directions how to eat them, or
they will simply put them in the oven, and they will be
like leather. When some people have offered me real
English muffins, bought at Pursell’s, with the crust like
leather, I have been astonished that they could like
them, and thought how they would enjoy them prepared
in real English fashion.”</p>

<p>Molly penned a little note of directions as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Lennox</span>:—I send you some English
muffins and crumpets made by Mrs. Welles, who is anxious
that <i>you</i> at least should eat them as they are eaten
in her country. She scouts the idea of their being simply
made hot in the oven, and is only surprised that, eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that way, they should be as much in favor as they are.
Both are to be toasted, and are better the day after they
are made. The crumpets are toasted both sides until
hot through, slightly browner and <i>crisp;</i> then butter,
very little salted, must be plentifully laid in little bits
on each one as it is toasted; then put it in the oven
while you toast the other. When the second is done,
the butter on the first will be soft enough to spread
without pressure. When all are buttered, cut once
through the middle.</p>

<p>The muffins are also toasted. They must be broken
all round the edge as if you were going to split them,
then toasted on <i>both</i> sides until the crust will crack under
the thumb nail. Rip them open quickly, put a bountiful
supply of butter, in small pieces, on the inside of
each half; close it and put it in the oven while another
is being toasted. When it comes out the butter will be
melted. Never attempt to spread them first, or they
will be heavy. If the butter has not spread all over,
you may gently use a knife to make it even, but <i>without
pressure</i>. When each muffin is put together again,
spread a little butter on the outer crust, and cut them
through the middle.</p>

<p>The essentials are that they should be well toasted, so
as to be <i>hot</i> through and crisp outside, then so quickly
buttered as not to get cold, and to be served very hot.
There is a covered dish on purpose, called a muffineer,
but lacking that, a hot bowl should be turned over them
to keep them hot.</p>

<p>It is English fashion, for tea, to serve both muffins and
crumpets. They are handed round together, a plate of
each, some preferring one, some the other. At breakfast,
muffins alone are usual. I just say the last to
round up the matter, not that I suppose you will care
one bit what the English mode of <i>serving</i> is, but I do
think, for the sake of our digestion, we should either eat
them toasted or let them alone. I send you over my
receipt-book, in which I have copied some things that
may be useful to both of us. You tell me Mr. Lennox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
writes out such things for you, and you can keep the
book until he has leisure.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Molly Bishop</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The pork hocks had been put on early for the mock
brawn, and taken out and boned. The stock was now
made, and Molly seasoned and prepared it in accordance
with her plan. The pieces of pork, the seasoning, and
the best of the beef, cut into pieces about two inches
square, and of which there was about twice as much as
there was pork, were put into the liquor, heated once together,
and then poured into a pan. It looked rather
like head cheese. When cold, it turned out in a slab.
Part was sent to Mrs. Lennox with an explanation of
what it was; part to Mrs. Gibbs, with the rest of the
meat made into the usual hash for her; and the remainder
was kept for home purposes, for both Mrs.
Welles and Marta found it very relishing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.<br />

<small>THE BABY—CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is July, nearly a year after Mr. and Mrs. Bishop began
the experiment of keeping house in Mrs. Winfield’s
cottage, which has become very dear to them both, although
in three months they are to leave it and go into
one of their own. So charmed had Mr. Bishop, senior,
become with Harry’s home that he had been a frequent
visitor during the summer, and sometimes Mrs. Bishop,
too, came; but society engagements took her time, and
when May came, she fled with her daughters to a fashionable
watering-place, and Mr. Bishop, instead of staying
as usual in his city house, came out to stay with his
son, and went in with him to business daily. The result
was that Harry was reinstated in his father’s favor, and
it seemed as if the elder gentleman was going to make
amends for his past mistake; for he told Harry he would
now do what he always had meant to do until he found
he was bent on making a fool of himself.</p>

<p>“Not that your luck is anything to your credit,” he
persisted; “it’s a mere fluke your getting such a wife as
Molly; but you’ll come into the firm as junior at Christmas.”</p>

<p>This was what Harry had been brought up to expect,
and the prospect that he had to give up on marrying
Molly. He was grateful to his father, for after all,
pleasant as life was for him even with his narrow income,
it was likely to be a great deal pleasanter when
he would not have to count every cent so closely.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are one who has the luck to ‘eat his
cake and have it too,’” said the old gentleman irritably;
“but I’m doing it just as much for Molly and the baby
as for you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, there was a baby,—a baby just thirty-six hours
old when Mr. Bishop announced his intention to the
young father; and Harry carried back to Molly that
evening a very glad heart. The baby was a girl, and
Molly’s only shadow was that Harry did not seem to
admire it so much as she thought it deserved.</p>

<p>“You mean to say you don’t think it’s pretty, Harry?”
she had asked when she exhibited the little red, squirming
thing in its nest of flannel.</p>

<p>Harry shook his head doubtfully. “I may see some
beauty later when, when it gets into some sort of shape,
and its head is screwed tighter; at present I don’t admire
it, but, as Mark Twain says, ‘I’ve a certain respect
for it, for its father’s sake.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry!”</p>

<p>This was in the morning before he left home, and when
he returned at night he went up to Molly’s room and
kissed her. He thought she must certainly see the good
news in his face, so accustomed was he to her reading
his countenance.</p>

<p>“Well, Molly, don’t you want to know the news?”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t asked after the baby;—don’t you
want to kiss it?”</p>

<p>“My dear Molly, your serenity told me how the baby
was,—and—and I wouldn’t disturb it to kiss it.”</p>

<p>“You never saw such a sleeper as she is; she won’t
wake, and <i>I’ve</i> hardly seen her eyes yet!”</p>

<p>“I hope she’ll continue such good habits; but now,
Molly, I have great news—news I expected some time,
of course, but not quite so soon.”</p>

<p>Then he told the news, and Molly responded only by
a closer pressure of his hand.</p>

<p>“And that is not all; my father has decided to buy
the Framley cottage and rent it to us, and says he meant
to give my wife a check as a wedding present, had I
married Miss Vanderpool, and now he sends it to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry, how good of him! how much is it?
That sounds greedy; but if it is enough we can furnish
with it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry opened his pocketbook and took out a check for
$1,000. “You must lay this by, Molly, for yourself;
you know I have $3,000 which we agreed never to touch
except for some emergency; but now that my prospects
are assured I prefer to furnish for you, Molly, rather
than you for me.”</p>

<p>“What will be your income, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing very splendid, for I am only junior with
a fifth interest, but it is the certainty of the future
that delights me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the proof of your father’s affection.”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>

<p>“You remember, Harry, what we promised each other,—that
even with a better income our expenses were not
to be increased?”</p>

<p>“Not while I was on a salary, dear; but I am quite
contented with the last year of our life; I want nothing
grander or better, but I do want to see you in your own
house furnished with your own taste, and replete with
all the conveniences that will make the housekeeping you
love, easy to you; and I shall insist on providing you
with such assistance as will save your health and strength.
But I am not anxious for style or show, and we will
waste no money upon it.”</p>

<p>Nor did they.</p>

<p>Mr. Framley had built one of the handsomest houses
in Greenfield, and the charming Queen Anne cottage
they had hitherto lived in had been for sale. Molly had
often pointed it out to her father-in-law and admired its
beautiful lawn and expatiated on the fruits and kitchen
garden, little supposing it would soon be her own home.</p>

<p>The only crumple in Molly’s rose leaves was Mrs.
Bishop, senior’s, views with regard to the baby. Molly
had had no babies: her mother-in-law had had eight, five of
whom had lived and flourished. But Molly had known
other people’s babies, and had made their experience her
own, so far as observation enabled her to do it, and she
had read all the good writing there was on the baby
question, and, as may be expected, had her views and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
naturally wished to carry them out in the person of her
own baby. If a woman can’t do what she likes with her
<i>own</i> baby, when is she to do it?</p>

<p>But, strange to say, the dowager, Mrs. Bishop, seemed
to feel the new comer was even more Harry’s baby and
her own grandchild than Molly’s child, and being her
first “posterity,” she was very much interested in it, and
she and Mr. Bishop had come to the Greenfield hotel in
order to be at hand.</p>

<p>Very soon Molly, with her latter-day views of baby
training, and Mrs. Bishop, with her experience of eight,
clashed. For days the struggle was silent, for she was
Harry’s mother; and all the directions for giving anise-seed
tea and gin and water, and paregoric, were quietly
disregarded,—but the tug of war came when Molly refused
to nurse it before the appointed hour.</p>

<p>“And you mean to say you will not feed that little
creature till the time <i>you</i> think it needs it? Can <i>you</i>
judge of a baby’s hunger?”</p>

<p>“Mamma, I asked the doctor to guide me, and all the
best writers say”—</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Mrs. Bishop, triumphantly.
“You are such a theorist, Molly; but you can’t bring
up a child by books, and it may cost you this one’s life or
health to find that out. I am surprised a woman of
your sense should not see that you can’t set up your
book experience against the practical knowledge of a
mother of eight.”</p>

<p>Molly made no reply: she could not be cruel enough
to hint that three of the eight had died.</p>

<p>Happily for Molly and the carrying out of her views,
Mrs. Lennox, who had become a very dear friend, was
with her very much, and it was her nurse, an intelligent
woman, who was in attendance; and between them they
had been able to save Molly much anxiety. She knew
that her own orders, and no one’s else, would be carried
out; this otherwise would have been a terrible anxiety;
for her doctor had said to her, in one of her talks with
him before the birth of the child, “Half the babies’ stomachs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
are ruined in the first month, and the poor baby becomes
a victim to colic and indigestion through that
month’s mistakes. Some babies are born to it, but these
are few compared with the many that are made to suffer
by bad habits.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop, senior, disapproved of the nurse, and
openly derided the doctor, and audibly scorned the idea
of putting a baby a fortnight old in “training” and
freely told her daughter that Molly was not fit to be a
mother; that she ought to have remained single and become
a doctress, or screeched for woman’s rights from a
platform.</p>

<p>The excitement of the contention on Molly had to be
stopped, and, unknown to his wife, Harry, instigated by
Mrs. Lennox, had to warn his mother that she must
leave Molly to her own ideas, even if they were mistaken;
and Mrs. Bishop had contented herself afterwards
with expressing her opinions and her fears. But
when, in spite of all, the baby flourished and grew fat,
and seemed freer from the ills of babyhood than the
average, she averred it was owing to the cast-iron constitution
it had inherited from its father. She declared
that “to point to Molly’s child as a proof that the new
ideas of bringing up babies are better than the old is as
reasonable as to point to the health and strength of the
Germans as a proof that babies ought to be swaddled
and bound on to boards for the first months of their
lives, in order to become so strong and straight. One
forgets the number who die under the process, and it is
only the very strong who survive.”</p>

<p>And this, strangely enough, was exactly what Molly
also said to herself when she heard that Harry “actually
owed his life to soothing syrup,” which had enabled him
to survive his teething troubles.</p>

<p>And so with a beautiful, healthy baby (whom, by the
bye, Harry now dandles with great pride), a new house,
and the delightful task of furnishing it, in these days of
pretty furniture and dainty devices, we leave Molly
with as bright a future before her as a loving husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
good health, good prospects and a resolve to be a good,
true wife and mother could give to any woman.</p>

<p>Of Marta there are a few words to be said. Those of
Molly’s friends who are not very often at the house consider
Mrs. Bishop a very fortunate woman in having
such a treasure. Molly herself thinks so; but I doubt
if half those who so speak would have been satisfied
with Marta’s moderate gifts. She was a treasure because
she was true and faithful in everything. Her
service was not better than that of any clean, strong,
willing girl, under the eye of an intelligent mistress.</p>

<p>“But Marta was such a wonderful cook!” some
would say. Marta would never be a good cook unguided;
it was not in her; she had had the exceptional
advantage of training under a woman who, if she had
needed it, had qualified herself to teach cooking professionally;
who cooked scientifically from precise rules,
and who herself had very little to learn when she began
with Marta, and who had patience as well as knowledge.</p>

<p>How few girls have such a chance! We send girls to
a cooking-school to take twelve or twenty-four lessons,
and we know that if they are of the right material (and
if not we should hardly send them), they leave the
school vastly improved, with quite different ideas from
those who have been through no such training; and
Marta had been at such a school daily for many months,
yet, at the end of them, her accomplishments were not
many. She could fry, stew, roast, and make soup to
perfection. She could not be trusted to do anything
that depended on <i>flavor</i> or <i>taste;</i> she never seemed to
learn that one clove may be pleasant, half a dozen detestable;
that herbs should only lend a vague savoriness,
never be so strong as to make one feel they were partaking
of marjoram soup or parsley stew. But Molly
knew her limitations and knew—take her all in all—she
was not likely to better herself by changing. A
girl of quicker wits might have been less faithful, or, if
so bright as to learn all Molly could teach, she would
naturally and rightly wish to take a place as professed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
cook, with her thirty or forty dollars a month wages, and
no washing. So Marta remained, a very devoted servant;
very exasperating sometimes, but at all times
valuable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox has only one thing to say; she does not
regret taking Maggie; she is no worse off in her pocket,
and is better off in nerves and muscles; the tired, overworked
look is no longer conspicuous. She is still overworked
and overworried, but she has a strong pair of
arms to call upon, and they are willing to do the appointed
task which Mrs. Lennox always remembers she
must otherwise have done herself. Maggie needed
watching at every turn the first few months; she now
knows the ways and does the work fairly well. She is
no paragon, and if Mrs. Lennox had no children she
would rather be without her, but when she gets out of
patience she looks back and remembers how she had
not even time “to think” before she came; when she
did sit down her muscles ached and tingled so that even
rest was a dull void, simply cessation from exertion.
Mrs. Lennox now does the cooking and the sewing;
Maggie does the work. She will never do more in the
cooking way than boil potatoes, make mush and bread
(the latter well, for she knows only one way and that is
the way she does it), and burn or smoke a beefsteak.
But Mrs. Lennox will soon have either to pay her more,
or take another new arrival; that is inevitable.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that all Molly’s neighbors were
as fond of her as Mrs. Lennox. No one can live up to
a higher ideal than the average (even when the ideal is
only cooking), without hurting some one’s corns.
Several ladies disapproved of her, thought she set a
very bad example by making men expect too much of
their wives, and those who lived very badly on double
Harry’s income felt personally injured.</p>

<p>But all this Molly did not know; she did not suspect
that her affairs were known or discussed, but before
leaving Greenfield Mrs. Winfield had spoken, with the
best intentions in the world, of this young couple’s romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
marriage, and the bravery required of a young
wife to face life on $100 a month, with a husband
brought up, as Harry had been, in such splendor and luxury.
This was naturally discussed till the story became
public property, unknown to the heroine of it, who had
no thought of setting an example, good or bad, or of
shining brightly by comparison with less clever or energetic
women; indeed, she was rather conscious of shortcomings
of her own. She looked hopelessly on the piles
of sewing some of her friends got through, with very
many calls on their time besides, and could only comfort
herself with the thought that her abilities did not lie in
that direction, and that she could only do the best that
was in her.</p>

<p>Another pleasure in store for Molly is that Mrs.
Welles is soon to be her neighbor; for Mr. Welles had
promised to build a house near them, in consequence of
which Harry predicts that Greenfield will soon have a
rival to Soyer’s celebrated symposium.</p>
